DotA2,Why are most of the Dota2 streamers so toxic in pub?,"For the past 7 years, i usually watch Dota 2 streams before bed to relax. But for the past couple of years, I noticed that most of the streamers including Pro players, are really offensive to team mates, toxic, and abusive.

Some of them start shouting madly during the stream, while anyone can see they messed up the game. But they definitely did not lose at the ""blame game"". Today, mason dota, last night Eternal Envy, few weeks ago, Quinn - everyone shouts so much on their own mistakes.

It has affected the viewership experience adversely, and resulted in the downfall of the streams viewers.

Edited: I also noticed some of the streamers, if they are in a heated conversation with someone, they would open their profiles live on stream, and encourage to avoid those players.",hiddencameraffs,10/03/23 08:00:12 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/11n8ev9/why_are_most_of_the_dota2_streamers_so_toxic_in/

DotA2,Death Prophet Questions,"I started playing this hero recently and she's right up my alley. I have some random questions...

Why wraith bands/agility items?

What other stats are important to know?

The shard feels weird. While the fear can remove someone from a team fight it's also helped people escape.

Her ult's cooldown is very long, how should it be used most beneficially and when should you refrain from hitting it?

Thanks for any tips!",wizardhat2011,08/03/23 10:01:25 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/11liwsn/death_prophet_questions/

DotA2,Why has Valve decided to let pos. 1 players down once again?,"**December 12th, 2016**. The day 7.00, incl. Monkey King, was released.

&amp;#x200B;

That was the last time we have received a viable safelane hard carry. Precisely **2278** days ago.

Since then, we have received a total of **11 new heroes**, all of which are not fit for the position 1 role.

Among those eleven heroes, every role except for position 1 has received something to be excited about. Let me list up a rough estimate of what hero can be played in which position, just to prove my point:

Pos. 1:

Pos. 2: Pangolier, Void Spirit, Muerta

Pos. 3: Pangolier, Mars, Marci, Snapfire

Pos. 4: Hoodwink, Dawnbreaker, Marci, Primal Beast, Dark Willow, Snapfire

Pos. 5: Snapfire, Dawnbreaker, Dark Willow, Marci

&amp;#x200B;

Notice anything?

I am fucking tired of looking forward to the next hero release, when all we're getting is a 3 point carry (?!) int hero that is undoubtedly not a true position 1 hero.

Has Valve chosen to completely **ignore** this? Or has nobody **in 7 years** ever questioned whether or not it would be a good time for a new hero that would provide excitement to what is essentially a large part of their playerbase (pos. 1 players)?

Add that on top of the massive joke that this patch was (let's be real, we were all expecting 7.33) and it's getting really hard to find reasons to keep playing this game as a safelane player.",AdhesivenessMassive7,09/03/23 11:00:16 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/11mgsax/why_has_valve_decided_to_let_pos_1_players_down/

DotA2,Muerta's W and R muts be swapped Just like how PL got a swap before in my opinion. here is why.,"As we all know muerte is abyssmal atm. with the shit winrate shit stats shitty unsynergizing spells blablabla. While i was playing and watching people play her, i realized a possible rework on her. Just an idea, i hope to get your answers on it on why it could work or could not.  


Her ult is janky as F. You go full magic yes but it does not work at all. Many cores especially the melee cores build mage slayer into bloodthorn, thus making her pretty much useless in ult form, rather than being threatening. I saw qojqva and gorgc play her. And qojqva memefully used her ult vs antimage and pudge few times to test and her already low dmg became even lower it was hilarious at one point.  


Her W Has no idea what it wants to be. A slow? disable? kite spell? gapcloser? make it easier to land a Q? either way i never found a decent reliable way to use it rather than just cause more fuckshittery during fights or place it in a way it will farm  


In my opinion her W and R should be swapped. her ult becoming a situational skill for going ether form to deal magic dmg and a possible way to counter ghost form from heroes such as pugna is decent.   
While her W after swapping will become a dmg amp for muerte, like drow ult. People in the area will be slowed and the spirits will leash the player for 0.5 second instead of silence (lvl 20 talent giving 1 more second leash, lvl25 talent making the leash pierce spell immunity blabla just random ideas here) and while in the area, muerta's attacks will pierce the natural magic resistance like drow R does, while resist from items, passives, auras will stay. So if she uses the calling with the ether form, her dmg will be amplified as they both synergize, making a possible ethereal blade build decent and actually deal dmg.  


Ofcourse her W and R will be tuned down accordingly to make it acceeptable. but a system like this would make muerta a decent core rather than a pos4 with pos2 dreams.",IShatMyselfInDota,13/03/23 01:34:39 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/11pkeyx/muertas_w_and_r_muts_be_swapped_just_like_how_pl/

DotA2,HELP! I drove 12.000 km on a moped from Denmark to Syria,"traversing the mountains of the balkans, and vast cotton fields of eastern greece with 35 km/h. I overcame endless engine trouble, breaking of wheel bearings, snapping spokes, arriving to Damascus, seeing the jasmine flowering along the sidewalks, and driving all the freekin way back again, arriving home on my farm with a hard rubber ass and mutant ship-of-theseus-kind of moped, with the back wheel barely hanging on.

I felt like a god damn hero, and then i boot up, lose 10 out of 11 games and go from archon to crusader and once again i'm back in the hamsterwheel of sucking, feeding too many kills and never able to farm faster than 480 gpm. Seriously, can somebody help me??? And don't tell me about bsj, farming backwards and stuff like that. I'm too stupid. Can someone coach me a game of two????? I need a comforting but firm voice telling me why i feed and why it's never me who is responsible for winning the games i play.

DotA2,So how are people building Muerta?,"I haven't had chance to play yet (having a job sucks sometimes), but I've had a look at the skills.

1. She screams mid. She's not a traditional scaling right-clicker, and her abilities look very glass cannon like, and she hasn't got great str gain
2. Attack speed, damage  and attack modifiers are both good on her (lol) given gunslinger gives extra attacks, and triggers any attack modifiers. 
3. She's strong before bkb, and when bkb durations are low, but she is very weak when your opponent has bkb active. Conversely with BKB on her, and Ult active, she is very difficult to kill.
3. She is slow and has no innate mobility.

Based on this I can see builds involving
Phase boots (for mobility, or potentially even BOTs)
Witch blade- gives more damage and slow 
Maelstrom -&gt; Gleipnir. The root sets up deadshot, and her W, and gunslinger gives extra lightning procs.
I can see her being one of the few heroes where Kaya/Yasha is an actual option, for the bonus movespeed.
Hurricane pike also helps with escape/positioning
Bkb seems really good with her Ult. Immunity to magic and physical for 8 secs is insane, and requires your opponent to have really strong stuns for you. 
Late game- skadi helps your tankiness, hex gives you lockdown, daedalus for damage, MKB for evasion. Standard stuff. Lifesteal is weird because I believe when you are ethereal and dealing magic damage, you don't Lifesteal with satanic/morbid mask, but would with voodoo mask. When she's not ethereal, she would lifesteal as normal. 
I can also see people trialing orchid/bloodthorn builds.

DotA2,Meurta is just dark willow but worse.,"meurta is very strong for farming yes but even when shes farmed she still cant fight that well. most of her damage comes from her ult (and e) but the ult slows her and doesnt even add that much damage while also allowing her to be targeted by spells, and then has a long downtime.

compare this to dark willow's w, which yes does require aghs but when you get it she gets far more bonus damage, cant be targeted by spells. she gets attack range, cant be slowed and has a better uptime. willow's w is also amplified by her talents trees which just give her litteraly everything she needs, more time in the w and more attack speed.

&amp;#x200B;

Now yes meurta does get like 70% bonus damage with the e which is very strong especially for farming. im just saying if your playing meurta and trying to build around the ult, you might consider dark willow.

DotA2,Abyssal Slark,"[https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2940499508](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2940499508)

![video](pl952oomkbma1 "" Abyssal Slark is a mysterious creature that inhabits the depths of the ocean. He is a legend among marine beings, known for his cunning and survival skills. Born from a solitary egg in a dark and deep crevice, Slark had to fight to survive from the beginning. He grew up among the most dangerous creatures of the ocean, learning to hide and strike with deadly precision.
"")

In his journey through the Obscure Reef, Abyssal Slark stumbled upon a sunken ship. Realizing he could use some of the wreckage to his advantage, he fashioned armor using ropes and accessories from the ship. One of the items he used was the ship's rudder, which he used as a defense against predators. Additionally, he anchored a metal weight to his tail to enhance some of his abilities and attached a poisonous snail to his arm to lull his predators to sleep with its venom.  


To complement his defense, Abyssal Slark fashioned a powerful cutting sword made of fish bones that he had to defeat to obtain the necessary materials. With his armor and sword, he became even more dangerous and lethal in the depths of the ocean.  


Abyssal Slark spent most of his life in the dark and dangerous depths, far from the reach of the inhabitants of the dry world. He is a master of stealth and a natural predator, capable of blending in with his environment and moving with incredible speed. Over time, he developed a wary and solitary personality, keeping himself away from other marine beings.  


However, when he heard about the Obscure Reef - an underwater prison for the most dangerous creatures of the ocean - he was intrigued. Abyssal Slark saw it as a challenge and an opportunity to prove his prowess and cunning. He decided to infiltrate the Obscure Reef, in search of new challenges and possible allies.

DotA2,"""Minor"" (lettered) patches aren't patches","Most of recent lettered patches have had the same format. Buff or nerf values of spells with +10 or -5, and do the same with some items. Does this really change anything within the game?

I'd argue it doesn't. Just to focus on the recent patch, 7.32e, we have changes like pudge's aghs rot does 5 less damage. What exactly does that accomplish or change? It feels like letter patches are we're gonna nerf the meta heroes (usually, sometimes they don't even do that) and then add random buffs to random spells of the remaining heroes.

There are exceptions of course, in the same patch we also got a nerf to Nature Prophet's sprout: it can't pierce bkb, which I think is a huge blow to the hero. We also got a nerf to treant's passive regen and his living armor was nerfed, also good changes.

Overall these lettered patches feels like 1 or 2 well needed changes and then the rest is they randomly picked heroes and skills and flipped a coin and increased or decreased a value.

There are shards and aghs upgrades in the game that are never picked or underwhelming, it would get great to see some reworks there, or even reworks to heroes.

There are also items that are never usually even bought, like holy locket, and I'd like to see a big rework of neutral items because it's very rng and there isn't any skill in getting unlucky with the neutral items you have. There are some tier 3 neutrals that I'd argue are worse than tier 2s.

I'd rather Valve focus on major patches that shift up the game then the lettered one that hardly change anything, obviously meta can get stale and many some minor tweaks here and there, but some of these changes just feel like ""fluff"": they're just there for the sake of making the patch look or seem big.",Dirty_Vish,08/03/23 12:31:16 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/11l3y8l/minor_lettered_patches_arent_patches/

DotA2,7.32e (Almost) Appreciation Post,"I think we all wanted 7.33, that’s no secret. And the changes in 7.32e were relatively minor overall, which can be disappointing. There’s also a good amount of fatigue since this is the longest patch in the game’s recent history, and that sucks no doubt. There’s a new hero, and some new stat UIs to look at, though, so it isn’t a *complete* bait and switch. It was a pretty significant patch for a letter update (pretty sure the only lettered update to release a hero).

Maybe I’m too patient for this crowd, but I will always give a dev team some grace when they say they need more time to get it right. There’s no shortage of posts with users grabbing pitchforks and assembling mobs, but I say hold the outrage until after the patch. If there’s one thing this dev team *rarely* fucks up, it’s quality. Let them do the **one** thing they consistently get right. 

Valve should absolutely update their communication model with the players so stuff like this doesn’t happen. And Valve should absolutely prioritize Dota’s timeline. I’m not debating either of those things. 

What Valve ***shouldn’t*** do is feel pressured to release a bad update just so they can sate the expectations of the babyragers. Cry until you’re blue in the face about how failing to meet expectations will kill the game, and you have a point there, but don’t think for a second that an incomplete, imbalanced, or bug riddled update would be preferable. You wanna talk about killing the game? A bad update would more than eliminate any positive growth the player base has had in the last few years.

So sit back, strap in, grab your copium, and take a few deep breaths. Good things to those who wait, or something like that.",Unputtaball,07/03/23 09:03:39 PM,https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/11kytem/732e_almost_appreciation_post/

Maxing your deadshot in lane and going for aether lens -&gt; forcestaff

Deadshot is nice to set up kills, push heroes into your tower or secure creeps.

I've been having great success with it and I think it's a lot of fun.

As a pos 5 I make sure to have 3 mangos, 6 tangos, sentry and fairy fire. Laning with heroes like drow ranger is awesome because you have insane kill potential, but your deadshot can also be used as a save if they go on your carry. Its much easier to push them into tower range from the safelane too.

I only tried pos 4 once and I went for a blight stone (similar to hoodwink) but it depends on the lane matchup.

I love the silence talent, I think this spell is incredibly strong and can win teamfights for your team.

I use the ult only if Im sure I wont be needing to use it defensively, otherwise I bait carries to jump on me and then use it, or if a random clinkz decides to combo me I can just absorb it all and survive with next to full hp.

DotA2,thoughts on muerta carry and build:,"so i was spamming muerta all day yesterday, and here are some things i figured out and final ""best"" build i have for her:

1. witch blade sucks ass. don't even bother. the only way it can be good is if you build brooch which costs a shit ton.

2. she need attack speed badly even tho good agil gain.

3. casual gloves of haste is nice, even if you want midas

4. best farming item is maelstrom. still

5. getting ranged on her is more important than spell immunity, you can get kited. i usually went maelstrom into bkb to fight, but felt like bkb wasn't needed as long as my team isn't 5 ranged heroes

6. pike very good item not because you can pike whoever jumps on ya, because you have ult anyways. however you get a force staff +range which makes you a bit more mobile 

7. blink feels very good on her to position well, same as drow sort of

8. brooch is nice because if your ult ends you still got some good dmg, and the attack speed is a lot when active. 100 or so

9. MJ vs gleipnir. I'd say situational but mj felt better because of the attack speed. the only way yu lack damage later into game is attack speed, if you buy a daedalus somehow with goo attack speed during your ult u just burst people 

9. learn to back off when ult ending, after ult ends try to cast fear and the calling, and wait for disables to be casted on enemy by your teammates ad then start hitting

10. her calling skill is very annoying to fight into and very hard to fight in.

11. her q is annoying more than anything. good wave clear

12. i tried her at mid 2 games, and she was magnificent. i was against bat, and he couldn't go on me as he would on other heroes. anytime he went for last hits i fear him into me and then casy calling, doing a shit ton of dmg to him. however i went for witchblade and missed one fear he went on me and lane was over for me xd. either way felt good to bully the bat

13.item build I'll drop for both mid and safe lane

safe lane: similar to lina, start with blades of attack and 3 branches, then order 3 tangos. finish flacon blade and go for treads. from there you can either go midas or maelstrom, and after finish the other one or just skip midas it's your call but i like midas attack speed more than anything. casual gloves of haste will do. from there build d lance and then get bkb if you want, if not finish pike if you don't want again xd buy gleipnir or mj if you don't lack catch on team. you can legit go refresher if your fights go long enough for 2 ult 2 bkb. buy blink for mobility and then from there build situational. u need dmg? daedalus. enemy has glimmer? cuz that's your counter support item, buy nullifier. enemy has passives hard to deal with, such as am magic res. just buy silver edge. enemy has a hard carry that pumps dmg and you can possibly get gone on? maybe silences you and doesn't let you ult, etc etc. buy e blade very good against hard carries you cam disable them or save yourself. it increases dmg too

14. suggestions you may see that I'm 100% sure doesn't work: mask of madness. while this is good for farming, i think she already farms fast enough. i wouldn't get mom and maelstrom both to then farm, maelstrom already good enough for farming. mom during ult is another suggestion i saw, and i just have to say no. you need to cast fear as it has a short cooldown. 

witchblade is a joke. brooch too expensive maybe if you have good enough money, as it doesn't even increase your dmg during ult. I'll add if i see more


15. how to use fear/calling

in mid lane was really easy, let them come for last hit, then use ranged creep to push em towards you then cast calling in a way thry get hit while feared. they have to walk back as they can't fight back into it. they are silenced and slowed. it's 100% win situation for you. another way to use in my is when near to some last hits, cast it on those creeps while fearing enemy and deny your own shit

in safe lane, again let them come for last hit and push them to you so they get out of position. pretty similar except for you have follow up from your support. another way besides securing last hits is casting it when your support is getting gone on. it completely removes a man from a fight for almost 2s before its maxed (its more than the fear duration cuz they have to walk back, slower than they were feared)

lemme know if you have more tricks and such


also counters to muerta : pipe for offlane, mage slayer for safe lane glimmer for support. i think all of them are pretty nice especially glimmer but there is nullifier for that(mage slayer bc of magic res). also i noticed that i take dmg from blademail in ult which is weird",ShickenButt,08/03/23 02:25:32 PM,https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/11lokkx/thoughts_on_muerta_carry_and_build/

* All hero selections are now blind

* Null Talisman, Wraith Band, and Bracer will double their bonuses at 12 minutes instead of 25 minutes
* Removed bonus damage to towers from all summoned units. Non-summoned units (lane creeps, dominated creeps) are still stronger against towers compared to non-Turbo Dota

DotA2,EG v.s. Shopify Game 3,"Late post but it hurts so much watching this game.

Shopify played great, those Lucent beams into Cr1t tosses were well-coordinated. Same goes for EG's chain stunning Rtz into kills.

But why is EG playing so greedy? Against a zeus, luna's Lucent beams and eclipse, where are the pipe and lotus orb? Then Pakazs tping into every fight, bkb hits Rtz 3 times, then changing focus to Fly. What threat does a silencer pose after pressing his R button? It's not a priority hero like an Oracle or Shadow Demon with a save.

Not from SA, but find it a real pity for EG to lose in a game that can go both ways on their home ground with so much love ~~whistling~~ from the crowd.

If I am missing something, please do share. Just trying to understand the game better. Thank you.

DotA2,How i reached immortal from herald 5 in a 8 months playing at 5 pos,"&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2wm7zwqaxima1.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=217d98f24d6ffb370a7008b80b444361879e5caf

It was a not hard after 5+ years of not playing dota. In fact I started to play at may 2022 on mid lane at 3300 mmr and in jule I had 1600 mmr 'cause of tilting\\aggression and so forth.

Started from jule 2022 I decided to switch to 5 position and choose main hero as dazzle, its the best sup ever with 1 spell 'cause foes do not understand or foes do not understand before u'll reached 4k mmr+ otherwise it's free mmr. The only thing u need its to destroy 4 and after it u can destroy 3 foe pos and it will be free farm for carry.

Starting from 3500-4000 mmr the foes goes smart and do not let u kill him just clicking, from this level u need turn on ur brains )

The second part I learned -  how to set wards. The 60% games depends of how u destroyed lane (with dazzle 1 spell) , the remain 40% - how u set wards. Just watch my replays I guess or watch some youtube guides. Use courier to deward and buy all obs + sentries.

Short overview from 1500 to 5600

1500-3000 - easy dazzle spam 1 spell

3000-3200 hard barrier of people. I went to 3300 and fell down to 2800 and so several times

3200-3800 easy up

3800-4200 the main very hard barrier

4200-4800 easy up

4800-5200 the very very hard barrier which I stuck about 3 months.

After 5200+ it was easy, literally some days.

&amp;#x200B;

Lets talk about behaviour score) From 3800 to 5500 I upped my mmr with 1800-3000 behaviour. I presume its a myth where u have some ruiners, low behaviour and etc. I do not imply that they doesn't exists, but its not a block for u.

Now my behaviour 4800 and I'm willing to improve it to 10k back.

&amp;#x200B;

When u pick Dazzle u need to ban axe, cause carry do not understand how to play vs it ( in 1500-4800), axe is not a block for dazzle, the **farmed** axe is a block) I have 80% winrate vs axe cause I know how to destroy him and 20% loses cause my 1 pos decided to pick am or so forth )

&amp;#x200B;

I found this heroes for best 5 pos: dazzle, jakiro - tier 1. Disruptor, wd, warlock - tier 2.

DotA2,Serious thread about dota addiction and tips on how to stop,"Well, basically, title... I have found some really old threads about the same exactly thing but they are 5 or 7 years old now.

For some context, I have 6500 hours at the game, have been playing since 2010ish (dota allstars - garena/RGC), and dota 2 since launch. Now sitting at 3.5k mmr, highest I ever got was ancient 4k mmr. I loved this game at first sight, played a lot with good friends from school, then met more friends because of dota (that are still my friends until this day) and we had a blast playing together until 2015-2017ish. Then met more friends at college, played with them... but at this point in time, every single one of them has stopped playing, I'm the only one remaining (I'm 26 yo and so are most of them)

I had some months without the game, uninstalling and installing back again, just to be frustrated once more. This game is not even funny anymore for me but for some reason I just can't stop playing. I even tried league, and other more casual online games but none was even close to the feeling of playing dota. I have a job, a lot of things to study, exercise, but still CRAVE some dota now and then, right now I should be sleeping for 2 hours, but instead I played 2 matches, one was fucking amazing and I destroyed the game with sand king offlane, went 13/6/21, but the second one (also sk off)... 2/14/8, which made me feel like complete shit. This is not something uncommon, this is 90% of the games that I've been playing recently. Either someone on my team ruins my mood and thus my game (even when winning, it's not about losing), or I ruin it myself getting tilted and answering to them.

I think that the main issue to me is: I have invested 6500 hours, 270 DAYS (of course there is idle but still), made a lot of friends in the way, ""studied"" the game, know a lot of tiny details about it, anyway, it's really hard to let it go for good

Things that I've tried but didn't work: uninstalling, unfollowing all twitch streamers, youtube, leaving this sub, anything that would remind me of the game I deleted/muted/hide, but the craving always came back... I guess I might need professional help. Any possible tip is appreciated

DotA2,Muerta is underwhelming,"I feel like none of her skills synergize properly with each other. The only thing she does is trick shot Q into a W and hope enemy doesn't simply walk out from it. Passive is ok but still doesn't fit with other skills and still lacking DPS wise since it only really scales well with agi and she's int. She has a really short transformation ultimate and nothing to lock enemies in place unless you Q fear them toward you or hope they stay within W aoe, both of which fail most of the time. Not to mention its completely nullified by BKB, at least other heroes can right click into BKB. 

This coupled with the really under powered talents is why no one seems to be winning with her (unless they are constantly baby sitted by god tier supports and 6 slotted late game).

DotA2,"7.33 Coming In April, but WHEN???","here my prediction + reasons.

1. if they released it before major, atleast need one or two week to balancing the patch. **15-22 April** make the hero balance before major, but it will make mess up with div 2. i mean usually after big patch there will be some problem like imba heroes or bug.
2. **2-4 april**, contrary to the statement ""*late April*"", but who knows there is still a possibility because it says ""*7.33 coming in April*""
3. and the worst scenario is after major **may 8**. but that would contradict with statements ""*coming in april*"" and ""*release in late april*""

Dota 2 stopped launching after the patch update.

I've tried to use other launch codes. Many say, that the -vulkan option should work, but it doesn't and there is no vulkan-option in my steams dlc file, just Dota Reborn. I've also tried the -autoconfig -dx9 -dx11 codes, all with the same disappointing result

I've reinstalled the game and also verified the files.

DotA2,A Chinese ex-pro player recalibrates his 8-9000 MMR account to 10 MMR.(probably BUG),"This BUG seems like is been fixed.

An ex-pro player and current streamer ""inflame"", he recalibrates his account from immortal and after he made 1-3 for the first 4 immortal games, he somehow ranked with legend players. And as he is winning his MMR is weirdly getting lower and lower.  At the end of recalibration, he ends up as 10 MMR with 7-3. This is so hilarious since he has to stream smurfing which is normally not allowed. I have never seen this before in my dota time so I would like to share it with you guys.

The fact that the entire ult is just Reveants Broach with some upgrades makes me incredibly sad and even more so when you consider that you have to commit with it, because you CAN NOT TOGGLE IT BACK OFF! Meaning that she will literally not be able to do anything to you in a fight if she ults and you drop a BKB on her. As soon as BKB's are on the field, her ult basicly turns into a moderately effective getaway tool and is pretty much only good for picking off supports and people who dont have the 1 Braincell required to buy a BKB against her.

This problem gets even bigger when you consider that her entire kit can be nullified with a single BKB cast. None of her abilities actually pierce spell immunity with the exception of her double shot passive, which does a whole lot of nothing if both targets are BKB'ed.

**Dead Shot** is a decent little tool for dealing damage to people, however the synergy with her kit is poor and it doesnt carry attack effects.

**The Calling** is probably the second worst thing after her ultimate, due to the fact that the ability just doesnt do ANYTHING but give a moderate Movement and Attack speed slow. Enemies can easily walk out of it without even touching one of the revenants that would do a measily 180 magic damage and silence them. The hitbox on the revenants is extremely tiny so unless you manage to keep an enemy locked in place for the full 10 seconds, they might not even get hit with a single ghost.

You might be able to force a hero into it with a riccocet from **Dead Shot** but they will only touch a single ghost at best, at worst the target just runs straight through without even touching one.

**MUST HAVE improvement points I see for her:**

* Make **Pierce the Veil** either toggleable (which is kinda stupid cuz you cast your ult for nothing) or make it so that she deals half magic half pure damage or something like that. The ult desperately needs to NOT be a shot in your own foot!
* Make the Revenants spawned from **The Calling** actually hard to evade by increasing their attack radius and the speed at which they rotate, so that staying in the circle or moving out actually becomes a choice and theres more synergy with **Dead Shot's** fear effect.

**Optional improvement I'd like to see:**

* Make **Dead Shot** physical damage and let it pierce BKB, so her kit isn't as neutered by BKB

# EDIT

After having played bunch more games on her in (unfair)bot matches and several more matchmaking games, Id like to say that I misjudged **Dead Shot** and **The Calling** greatly. Deadshot in particular is a very nice nuke with some good utility, espeically with her talents that give extra damage and cast range. You can very nicely force enemies out of position with a well placed shot on a tree that hits them from behind.

I still think **The Calling** could use a little bit more cast range and the ghosts could use a bit more range, but otherwise is fine

Her ult still feels a little wonky with the relatively long activation delay and it being a full commitment to casting it in a fight since you cant toggle it. IMO they should bring the activation more in line with TB's **Metamorphosis.**

Now the biggest problem I see with her now is how slow her base speed is. Heros can very easily run away from her while she triggers the ult.",Bitterholz,08/03/23 02:20:04 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/11l6uiw/muerta_is_underwhelming/

DotA2,Idea for Muerta Buff,"I've been playing Muerta any chance I get. I believe she is unique and extremely fun! However, she just feels underwhelming. As it sits, Muerta has a very low win rate at all MMR brackets. My idea: make her ult a toggle.

- 1 sec Toggle CD
- Drains Mana/Sec

As a Carry, she feels really bad when the enemy gets a BKB because while ulted, she will not deal any damage to them.

Making her Ultimate a toggle, would give her the ability to turn it off and on during fights, and not just be stopped because the enemy has Magic Immunity. This gives her better manfighting potential.

I believe she excels as a Ganking hero (more of a pos2 than a 1). But once the enemy gets BKB you can't do a lot. She needs too many items, is very squishy, and does not do well in a 1v2

DotA2,Do you like Lifestealer's aghs? Cos me likey so much (4k MMR gaming),"I know this is kinda an unconventional build, but i have 8 winning streaks with this build. It's kinda fun too!

Skill build will depend on how good/bad your lane is. If you can easily harras their offlaner, then max 3. If you need to keep trading hit, max 2 or at least skill up 2 points. I normally start with orb of corrosion and phase boots. Then rush radiance. Once I have radiance, I can pretty much join the team fight. Then the next item will be the satisfying aghs.

This is where the fun starts. With +150 infest damage talent, you can pretty much nuke any supports. Basically when you infest the enemy (not your ally), you get free hits, slows, radiance burn, life steals, disarming, and big nukes at the end. 

Then depending on how the game goes, I usually like to buy BKB on top of rage. Basically all you have to do is to survive for 20secs (yes, aghs reduces your ulti). So buy whatever you need to ""get inside"" your enemy over and over again (yamete kudasai senpai!!). 

There was a match where I had to buy BKB, Linken, and Manta just because the enemy team had many silence and cc. You might think ""bro, you deal no damage with that build"". But in fact I dealt over 150k damage in that match, even my items were not built around high damage items.

DotA2,EHOME explained what happened on their side.,"TLDR: Their DPC-S slot was sold to another company, but the name EHOME was maintained for 2022-2023 season, to protect related cosmetics' name

They set the article (see bottom) as follower-only. So it's not a good idea to put down everything here. But I'll do my best to neutrally convey the idea and the community judge it. It's not about the ban and ending up like Newbee. They think it's justified. It's about the EHOME title: how they ruined the name EHOME in the worst way possible, at least according to themselves.

Back in 2015, they reformed an EHOME based on Team LV, which was successful (for example, top 6 in Ti 5&amp;6). But in 2020 EHOME found it difficult to run the team. Later they signed a contract with LGD and Blade Tech (刀锋科技, I'm not sure which one exactly, so Blade Tech is not an official translate, perhaps the official website is dofun.cn ). The team was then run by these two companies, during which the team became successful.

**(Core story here)** However in 2022, COVID and a lot of things put the contract to an end. They initially decided to quit Dota 2 for good, but they could not let the story end here because of their DPC-S slot. LGD and Blade Tech sold the slot of EHOME to a third party team (Unity Gaming), but EHOME couldn't get away with it because the slot is bonded with team ID (EHOME's ID is 4). This bind mattered a lot. Changing name to Unity Gaming unexpectedly changed a lot of EHOME-affiliated cosmetics' name, which is not acceptable (imagine being an EHOME cosmetics collector, out of the blue you became a Unity Gaming collector). Nevertheless, Perfect world declined their request to untie the slot. So they had to compromise: let the new third party team use EHOME for the 2022-2023 season.

We all know what happened next (Valve + PFWD whacked a ban that has totally killed EHOME). They have nothing to complain, but only regret of not doing enough during the transfer of the slot. At the end of the day, a glorious team ended up as a banned team, for cheating and/or fixing. EHOME could've died peacefully with dignity.

Bonus: I read somewhere that Team ID 2 and 3 were Team Zenith and Team Complexity, and ID 1 is for test or backup. Couldn't confirm it anywhere on the Internet and I have no access to the database, but I suppose it can't be very wrong. These two teams were founded in 2012, and maybe Valve built their official team system in 2012.",Desvl,10/03/23 12:57:55 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/11mxbmq/ehome_explained_what_happened_on_their_side/

First time playing rubick since 7.32e and I played like 5 turbo matches with friends. Some of spells I stole were quickcasting, like shadow shaman, shrapnels and muerta spells.. But when I got some witch doctor and mars spells, (spear, cask, maledict and deathward) all of them were not quick cast. I ticked and re-ticked all the boxes (D and F for stolen spells), including hero specific hotkeys to quick cast but still they will not quickcast. 

Some spells do not have hotkeys/are different from  D and F.

is this a bug? or a new feature? Or am i stealing the 'settings' of the other player like if he plays with a non-quick casted spell, i get a non quick casted stolen spell?

all of these happened only ever since the new quick cast settings qol update.

Any fixes? Thanks in advance!

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Stolen spells inconsistent. Some not quickcast, some quickcast but i never changed settings. non quickcasted spells cannot be changed to quickcast too.

Should it not be removed at this point, so that we can just purchase items from the shop menu?

DotA2,With the Recent Match Coordinator 'encryption' - Feeding accounts has overtaken selective targetting,"With the recent Valve changes for MM, a compensation strategy for account- sellers &amp; boosters/ a new problem arises.

It is a chinese phenomenon (""paid actor"") now brought to western MM:     
You can claim a critical role, and you play barely indistinguishable enough to not be suspicious for overwatch or reports.   


Generally you will either feed summons (ie LD bear) or have problematic feede (ie. Silencer) whilst simultaneously blocking a critical role (mid or carry) and often revolves around a completely underwhelming core that will always be pseudo- useless even for cases where it is given opportunity to perform.   

***

In a general sense, if you sit in queue and when the queue either:      
A) Match was ready, but someone declined: usually a coordination mismatch/ a dodge.     
Alternatively, queue timer randomly reset (perhaps recently patched?).             
B) Queue popped instantly for a non-demanding role: Someone dodged someone - and the system is looking a for s*cker to play this match.

DotA2,Helping With Sentries As A Mid,"Hi! I had this idea of helping with buying sentries as a mid player. Basically my idea was everytime I go back to to refill I buy a sentry or 2. Generally I go back to base 3 or 4 times during a match. Sentries cost 50 gold so it isn't much and could relieve a little bit of pressure off my supports and save them some time from traveling to deward as well which would translate to them having more time to do other things or gaining exp and gold.

I can buy the sentry and place it when I go to important spots for example the triangle. I can make up the 50 gold easily since I am mid and the Sentries would help secure important locations like the triangle for me and the carry.

Would this be a good idea? Has anyone tried this? What has been your experience regarding this?",ShiroyoOchigano,10/03/23 08:55:06 PM,https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/11nogcm/helping_with_sentries_as_a_mid/

# Developer log:

&gt;A couple of days ago I was watching a streamer play Rankdle and saw him as well as his chat wishing there was a Dota 2 Rank Guesser so I figure I'd give it a try. I been developing games for over 12 years- 9 of which have been professionally at different studios so I knew I could do this pretty quickly.  
&gt;  
&gt;There were a couple more features I wanted to add/improve upon but unfortunately I have other projects that take priority at the moment.

# 

# My plugs

&gt;I published a Rubick/Doctor Strange inspired game on Steam as a free to play game last year, if you would like to try it- [here is a link](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1451570/Cosmic_Magus/) or just simply search for ""Cosmic Magus"" on Steam. I also upload a lot of game development related content on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/Daitli), I have made a few DotA games in my [Fiverr series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7-cqsVREuR2ihJlvGpgeXX_ALgZ9pGRK) as well as many tutorials on [how to program DotA abilities using C#.](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7-cqsVREuR1PQlq7vHnL6vunebrykt1j)

If you have any suggestions for Oracle's Prophecy, leave a comment down below and I will consider them for the next update. Cheers guys, I hope this makes the long queques a bit more tolerable for you all :)

DotA2,Battle cup ended prematurely because someone failed to connect,"Just queued with my friends to compete in the Battle Cup. We won the first game, but when we registered for the second game, one of the opponents failed to connect to the game. Because of that, we got kicked from the battle cup and couldn't find new opponents for the 2nd game.

This means anyone who doesn't connect can kick the enemy team from the battle cup.

DotA2,Recent packet loss - How can I understand why/where is happening?,"Hi,

Over the past 2~3 weeks I've started experiencing packet loss (both in and out - the loss is usually symmetric - i.e. if I lose 10 packets out I also lose 10 packets in).

I'm not quite sure what's going on - I play on fiber optics, London, and my ping is around 13~14 msec; I don't use a Wi-Fi, Ethernet cable directly attached to the router (1 Gbps).
Some matches are perfect, 0 packet losses, some others is a continuous 30+, then 15, then 3 and then again 15 and so on.

I checked the network activity during such events and seems to be fine - i.e no activity ongoing. Not quite sure what to do next and/or how I can solve or workaround this.

Any help is appreciated.

Thanks!

DotA2,7.33 will bring basic attack type attribute (and will probably be 8.00),"Time for schizo theories.

There's a leak, that the very basic 500-gold Cloak will cost 1000 gold in the new patch. Since it's obviously a basic craft item, it's not going to get any special abilities for sure; so what could be the reason behind such growth in the price? That's on one hand.

On the other hand, Valve is flirting with magic damage type as a base attack type.

First comes Revenant's Brooch, which allows anyone to deal magic damage with basic attacks. At first I thought that this was just a way to actualize Ethereal Blade for intelligence carries - it gives them flat damage, mana regen, mana pool, some kind of protection and disable; bit without Brooch it's more of a defensive item, what doesn't suit carry role much.   
It also looked like a step to weaveing ""ghost"" status deeper into the game - Valve ^(and everyone else I guess) doesn't like rare game mechanics - a mechanic must be present widely, or not be present at all: we've had ""fear"" and ""root"" since Dota 1, but barely any skills or items provided them all along (originally the only source of ""fear"" was Lone Druid's Savage Roar, and Rod of Atos was close to the only source of root and was not that popular). Now ""root"" is something very common thanks too Gleipnir, and more and more skills provide ""fear"" - Muerta's Dead Shot is the latest example. But spreading ""ghost"" requires more then just adding more of it - untimely ""ghost"" is still a good way to ruine a fight and turn it upside down even with a lot of mages in the team. So Brooch looked like an attempt to fix it.

Everything's looking the way it's supposed to be. But then comes Muerta, which outputs insane amounts of magic damage, even for solid casters like Invoker or Skywrath Mage... and does it with basic attack! Surely can use 100% of even an untimely ""ghost"". But she doesn't come alone - she brings some really bad news for tanks, as they can't really do anything with those crazy damage numbers. An average tank has at least 70% resistance to physical damage, and still gets killed by it. Stacking magic resistance is way harder. Yes, bkb entirely blocks her ultimate, but it's easier for her to wait for you to spend your time, then for you to force her press the button. But of course, Muerta is not a reason to change the way armor works - she's just one special case.

Or not? Valve is trying to introduce something like magic damage carries for a long time. Initial version of Kaya appeared to be something to OP, as well as Null Talismans buffing magic damage, but Kaya is still there. Neutral items, reducing enemies magic resistance or buffing magic damage are kept being introduced. Spell lifestal is a common thing today. Primal Beast just does it right now - deals his primary damage as magic damage with his W. We even had magic damage amplification from intelligence once. Something is certainly cooking. And I'm sure that basic magic attacks will be that cooking boom - this would bring a tonne of changes to the game, give it a new breath and a new depth.

But making magic damage something that common will surely require armor system update. And a sign of it is in the leak - Cloak gets pricey. It will still be a basic item - as it should be - but now it will be an analogue of Platemail for magic damage which costs 1400.",danillissimo,09/03/23 12:56:03 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/11m1ifm/733_will_bring_basic_attack_type_attribute_and/

DotA2,Don't touch Turbo,"&gt;As Turbo Mode increases in popularity, we’d like to make sure we’re doing all we can for that group of players.

So after completely killing whole dota balance and seeing that players start to change game mode, you decide to KILL TURBO AS WELL? Look what you have done already? We have duplicate heroes now, game is unplayable, 1 thing you've done and its all broken.

If Turbo gaining popularity, maybe you try to make normal dota better? Make a survey, ask people? Why you trying to change something that works great? You playing these modes? Do you know anything about them? Why people changing them? Choosing over AP or Ranked?

\- NO you not. So stop.

I have been playing only turbo for past 2-3 years, before that i had top 200 rank eu. But since around 2018 you rapidly start making game worse. Last nail in a coffin was talents + aghanim + aghanim shard to every hero + 30 lvl cap + neutral items. In a such short period of time you add million things to the game. Now it's chaos, it's terrible. Like half of the spells has description unreadable long and confusing. Even i with trillions of hours in game has to read what shard do to that hero, or what talents others have. Can't imagine what is like to newbies.

Nobody wants to play stressful, pointless, boring, conformist (by guide), unbalanced, long matches, with social rating. And watch them as well (cybersport).

Turbo is a last bastion of fun and freedom of playing we have.

DotA2,Major's Dota 2 team ranking?,"Hey Reddit, I just wanna share my own ranking of Dota 2 teams and regions. At first I just wanted to know the power of regions because the theme of major slots' dividing is pretty actual nowadays, so I wondered how can we measure teams' performances by some value.

I was inspired by UEFA national associations ranking (or maybe it was just the team ranking, don't remember). They used to give teams points for wins or draws, bonus points for achieving a high place in tournaments, and (maybe I'm wrong) they used to assign smaller coefficients for earlier tournaments. This idea seemed to me pretty interesting, that's why I tried to adapt it to DPC system.

&amp;#x200B;

***NOTE:*** in my opinion, there is no perfect way to make a clear team ranking, as well as in any other sport, and I don't state that my system is even a good one, but maybe someone will find it curious or interesting at least. It was created just out of curiosity and I'm ready to discuss technical or some other highlights in comments.

&amp;#x200B;

# Here are the base rules of the ranking:

&amp;#x200B;

**1)** As we want to measure teams on the international arena, DPC leagues results are not counted. Only results on Majors and TI's are included.

&amp;#x200B;

**2)** The team gains:

* *2 points* for winning a bo2 or a bo3;
* *1 point* for draw in a bo2 or winning a bo1;
* *0 points* for losing a bo1, a bo2, or a bo3 either.

&amp;#x200B;

***NOTES***:

Winning a bo1 gains only 1 point because sometimes it can be quite randomish.

Losing a bo3 with 1-2 score gains 0 points because when bo3 is played on TI or Major there's always no matter you lose it 0-2 or 1-2: it will always gives you the same change of the tournament situation.

Tie-breaks are also included.

&amp;#x200B;

**3)** Team gains up to 6 bonus points for finishing in the top 8 according to the following order:

* 7-8th place - *1 point*
* 5-6th place - *2 points*
* 4th place - *3 points*
* 3rd place - *4 points*
* 2nd place - *5 points*
* 1st place - *6 points*

Bonus points for placing high in Wild Card tournaments are not scored.

&amp;#x200B;

**4)** There are a coefficients attached to every tournament. They are determined by the following rules:

* Last (or ongoing) tournament has a 1 base coefficient. Earlier tournament has a coefficient of 0.8; earlier to it - 0.6, etc., down to 0.2.
* TI's coefficients are doubled.
* If tournament has a wild card stage the coefficient of WC tournament has a base value of 0.5 (0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1), no matter it's TI or not. I can not give WC a bigger coefficient because such teams like Team Liquid or Team Secret would get TOO MUCH points for a TI 11 Last Chance, for example.

&amp;#x200B;

**EXAMPLE**. Up to now the coefficients dividing looks like this:

\- Lima Major - 1

\- TI 11 - 1.6

\- TI 11 LCQ - 0.4

\- PGL Arlington Major - 0.6

\- ESL One Stockholm - 0.4

\- TI 10 - 0.4

&amp;#x200B;

When the Berlin Major will begin the picture will change to this:

\- Berlin Major - 1

\- Lima - 0.8

\- TI 11 - 1.2

\- TI 11 LCQ - 0.3

\- Arlington - 0.4

\- Stockholm - 0.2

&amp;#x200B;

**5)** I used to assign points to organisations, that means Betboom Team got their points for both the old and new rosters, despite they are completely different.

There's only one exception - Evil Geniuses points include the results of the old Thunder Awaken roster, as well as Shopify Rebellion include the results of the old EG. I think that this should be fair.

&amp;#x200B;

**THE LAST EXAMPLE BEFORE THE LIST.** Let's count the points of Team Liquid.

Their score is **25 points** for Lima Major (6 bo2 wins (12 points), 2 bo2 draws (2 points), 3 bo3 wins (6 points) and reaching the 2nd place (5 bonus points)), 25\*1.6 = **40 pts** for TI 11, 16\*0.4 = **6.4 pts** for TI 11 LCQ,  7\*0.6 = **4.2 pts** for PGL Arlington Major and 7\*0.4 = **2.8 pts** for ESL One Stockholm.

Overall the sum of their points is 25+40+6.4+4.2+2.8 = **78.4**.

&amp;#x200B;

# So here's how the ranking currently looks like:

https://preview.redd.it/k869g2a4i3na1.png?width=931&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=0b42b0fd68f11f575b0f5d528f7f48e7de939cdd

***Some notes:***

* There are 6 teams from the WEU, and all of them are in the top 12.
* The bottom WEU team, Entity, is higher than the top SEA team, Talon.
* Despite Team Secret and OG have missed the last major, they are still holding their positions in top 10.
* However, winning the last major gave Gaimin Gladiators only the 10th place on the list.
* Ranking clearly shows, that the SA region has two solid teams and it is not a weakest region at all.

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Let us think a bit more about the slots dividing. If we sum points of the teams from the one region, and if we sum all the slots the region got on every tournament we consider, we can calculate the average amount of points gained by an average team from a single region.

For example: China's points sum is 167, and sum of its slots is 5 for TI 10 + 0 for Stockholm + 3 for Arlington + 2 for TI 11 LCQ + 3 for TI 11 + 4 for Lima = 17.

Average amount of points that a single team from China gains one one tournament is 167/17 = 9.82

And so we get interesting results:

https://preview.redd.it/epmadbq5i3na1.png?width=995&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=020e1d60da7b5cb8cff212a556115fd1a6577380

Honestly idk what exact conclusions we can make from this data and is it right to make any of them, but if I relied on thus I'd rather say that it is fair to take away a slot from China and give it to SA (which was oblivious without this ""research"" haha).

Also we may notice that the SEA region looks like the ""weakest"" and only the Talon's good performance in Lima keeps it's index on the road.

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------

At most in a game i can only remember a 1-2 people using comms for shot calling and the rest would just listen. I also dont remember ever being pressured or flamed for not using voice comms. My experience is all on europe. Maybe im just forgetting all the bad experiences, what do you guys think?

DotA2,How do you farm as P1 when both sidelanes are losing?,"I've been trying out P1 a bit. I watched a few guides online and pretty much all of them are:

1) Just try not to die during laning phase

2) When lane gets too dangerous, farm top lane/jungle

and every video the offlane has pushed the enemy carry out of lane and it looks mostly abandoned. P1 farms the little bit of enemy jungle + lane.

In my last 3 games this hasn't been an option. Either offlane lost the lane is still going. When that happens i'm not sure what to do. It's often too dangerous to stay in my lane so the only thing I can farm is the safest part of my jungle and the 2 camps on the offlane jungle. That's what i've been doing but I feel like i'm falling really far behind in net worth without being able to touch the waves.

Any advice? Any good videos that cover something like this?

I had this match with a guy  on our team who was support role but picked slark, and then CG whos on offlane, was very angry and did not even negotiate. And he just said, I'll feed if Slark doesn't buy Ward. Clock has every reason to be angry, but I don't think purposefully feeding  will help. However, he did 1-19, and we lost as a result. Slark was also pretty terrible too, and he didn't care if cg was feeding or if we lost.What should I do other than blacklist them and report them? I'm getting pretty upset cause I had a couple of these games in a row. I played the drow btw.

1. Given I am queuing in a party

This is wild. I get returned to matchmaking and _immediately_ find a game, because I suppose this is the _high priority queue_.

**I have to decline that game** while we re-invite our party member to the party.

Now we are banned from queueing because we failed to ready-up.

For Scepter, I have 2 ideas.

The first one upgrades her ult. Making her do pure damage instead of magical and adding extra attack range. I would go for 200 units cast range.

The other idea is the ability to place a ghost like entity, similarly to how stone spirit creates statues. On itself, it does nothing, but if you hit it with your Q, it fires a weakened Q towards each enemy in a 350 units radius. I would go with 50% less damage, and 35% less fear duration. I will put on a 40 seconds cooldown and about 100 mana cast.

For her Shard I will go for making her Q pierce one more enemy hero.

DotA2,"Muerta Aghs/shard ideas, promoting ability synergy","So my biggest issue with the new hero is that her abilities don't really seem to synergize. Her passive and ult do beautifully, but her first two abilities really don't. Deadshot is a fantastic ability, the spirits is a weird one though. You could theoretically fear someone into a spirit, but at best only one, at worst none, and the damage is sub par. So my ideas for the two items is mainly to produce more synergy between the abilities.

Shard

Something simple but affecting is shard could make the spirits auto attack. Give them melee range, or even less, and their attacks produce the same effect as if they walked through them. Does the damage and silences them. It essentially increases their aoe hit boxes but instead of just flat increasing it, it adds flair to increasing it

Balancing points for shard

I'm adding this after the fact. The points in which shard could be balanced is the spirits attack speed, it could do reduced or increased damage, it's attack range could be changed, also whether or not you can get attacked by one and then also touch it for a second instance is a point of balance.

Aghs

Now this one might be too OP, but I think it would be cool if with Aghs, hitting a hero with Deadshot splits their spirit from them for x seconds, and Muerta shoots that spirit on cool down. Think wind rangers focus fire, but with a Monkey King ult attack cool down. And because it's a spirit, the attack does magic damage. The idea is to get two or three auto attacks off at possibly reduced damage, possibly full damage, depends on how op it is. Remember, this is a 4200 gold item, it should have a large impact on the hero

Balancing points for Aghs

So even though I think this could be op, it's also very easy to tweek the numbers to make it not op. First, the attacks could be brought down to 80% her attack value, 50%, or anything. Also, the speed at which she auto attacks them could be changed. The duration the spirit lasts could be changed. I think the idea is how many attacks should she get off, and how fast the target has to react to the damage",Gellzer,08/03/23 04:40:42 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/11lanba/muerta_aghsshard_ideas_promoting_ability_synergy/

DotA2,What’s going on with ranked :(,"Context:

I first got into this game when my high school had a small esports club in 2013-17. Got into the game right as patch 6.82 (the one that neutered split pushing a lot) went out. Enjoyed it a lot and got to learn with some friends. Did ranked and got to like 3.3-3.4K mmr at best (I was and will never be good at the game just casual) didn’t have a pc I could use for college so I quit playing for about 7 years 

I got back into the game in October 2022 when I bought a brand new spanking gaming pc that could actually run this monster, and honestly I LOOOOVE what they have done to the game. I love playing pubs now and recently decided to start calibrating for ranked. I’m going to guess I will eventually end up in high crusader maybe low archon. But OH MY GOD ranked is so much more toxic than it was. WHY!? unranked doesn’t feel nearly as toxic at its worst.",repeter31,11/03/23 08:53:15 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/11o6btg/whats_going_on_with_ranked/

DotA2,Winning Lanes as Earth Spirit,"Hi all!

Hope y'all are doing good.

Hard stuck 2k scrub looking for advice on laning with Earth Spirit - he is by far my most played hero and I have an okay win rate on him (honestly I just love plying him).

However, looking at my Battle Stats my lane win rate with him as a soft supp is laughable - 37%.

It's definitely the part of the game I most struggle with as an ES player - mid game and team fights are much easier for me.

Anyone have any advice for improving laning as a support (primarily offlane supp) Earth Spirit?

https://www.twitch.tv/narodcast3

Despite being ongoing for weeks, they delete the vod after each match

The caster always pans to a different side of the map while some suspicious kills occurs (such as the current Rose vs EV, a drow ranger tping into a solo lifestealer and dying immediately) or other games where Furions tp to 4 people to feed kills. There was also one match where a Faceless void chronosphered a void spirit and ran away with one hit left but chrono was still up for a few seconds.

I found out about this information when my friend would not stop telling me to place a wager on this game as if he was so sure about the outcome. This was last week. I started watching this tournament with him, he always got them right. Sometimes he would switch sides right before a wager closes and the odds would follow his switch. The thing that solidified my suspicion was when i saw someone message him the name of the team “Reaper F10k” and it also turned out like that (the message bubble popped up on the smart tv where he was hdmi sharing his laptop.

It’s kinda disgusting how blatant they’re being. And all they need to do is delete vods and they get away with it. And its one of the channels with the highest views in the dota category too.

Patch quality has gone down.

Tournament production is in the gutter.

This could all have been avoided.

In all seriousness, it feels like every major change is lazy, poorly thought out, and makes the game worse. The big highlights of the last few years have been making jungle creeps mildly more annoying, removing unique mechanics, and inconsequential numbers tweaks of little impact.

&amp;#x200B;

And I'm not just referring to Techies. Look what they did to Dazzle. Look at Medusa losing her ability to instantly refill mana.

DotA2,Thanks to the dota devs for not releasing a half baked patch,"It's done when it's done. Quality takes time.

I don't think most dota players want you to rush, either. When you guys rush, you break the game and nobody wants to play. Dota is really fun right now. Delay the major patch again if you want..

Muerta is pretty cool, too.

Also, a lot of players miss the macro aspects of the game. For many years now, the best way to farm is to team fight. That's valid, and it's been really fun, but I miss being able to have come backs through good macro play. This added a lot of depth and strategy to the game, and made the map more open to skirmishes and ganks in the mid game, as opposed to non-stop death balling.

She cant flashfarm, she cant burst untill 3-4 good slots (and even then she deals zero dmg into bkb while in ghost form), she cant split because once again she is a slow hero.   


She has less than 40% winrate for a reason. Change her passive and ulty and make her a full mid or support at this point. She is not becoming a carry with this skillset.",Blurable,08/03/23 09:38:10 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/11lid9l/okey_now_lets_give_an_honest_opinion_about_carry/

DotA2,Mureta's needs a rework.,"Take a 2nd &amp; think about her skill synergy, and what exactly is she suppose to accomplish design wise. To me, it seems like someone couldn't decide how to combine all the cool ideas they had, and stuck them all together. 

I mean it's great to have versatile heroes, that can play multi roles, but this one ends up as a mess, and let me explain why... I want to keep this brief, so here's the Gist.

&amp;#x200B;

**CURRENT**

* 1st two skills are both very support like. They both nuking spells, with a disable of some sorts. They don't really do anything when it comes to helping a hero be a carry.
* 2nd two skills on the other hand, are both right click abilities. Great for a carry, but require the good farm to make good use of them... the complete opposite of what a support wants.

That is the issue right there. Her skills are so evenly split, it's hard to build items for a hero like that, and make a good impact. Maybe if they were one sided more she could have something to lean towards, but she's stuck in an ugly place right now.

&amp;#x200B;

**SUGGESTION:** Don't balance her. Begin the process of reworking her. Either keep her current concept &amp; delve deeper into the core role, or change her to a more support hero... Personally if the drastic change of a support were to happen, I'd prefer her with one gun, or become a musician, but that's another topic.

**P.S.** *Her ult sucks. Essentially it's just bonus dmg, with the utility to avoid physical dmg, but with the trade of to do less or no dmg to spell resistant enemies. Give her Lifestealer's passive ability as an ult to deal more dmg based of an enemies HP, and she won't need a rework.*",Venichie,13/03/23 05:08:53 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/11ppx80/muretas_needs_a_rework/

why tf the shot stops moveslows from working on enemies ? its kinda stupid seeing a slowed enemy run at 550 ms.

you cant attack in the ult transformation time it works for metamorphs like tb meta or lycan cus they have like 30 sec duration but she just loses 0.5 sec of the 8 sec ult and has to wait there like a headless chicken.

DotA2,Can someone help me/give advice on how to enjoy other things (especially games)?,"Hello,

If someone is bored enough to read this and give an honest opinion I would really appreciate it.

I am sure there are many of us who have been there and posted similar rants here, so I am sorry if I am breaking some posting rule.

Anyways, I'm 26 years old and I've been playing Dota 2 since 2012 (played DotA for a year or two). My highest MMR was around 3700. Now I am at around 3000 MMR and in the last 20 days, I reached legend 1 three times and every time I did, I lose 6 in a row. 

And it has become frustrating.

Now, a few disclaimers:
- I know my rank compared to my playtime sucks, but let's be honest, majority of dota players are the same.
- My behavior score has ALWAYS been 10000 and I consider that system to be a total fraud.

The point I am trying to make, Dota is making me miserable and I can't stop playing it. It has never been an impact on my social life or work, I have a decent job, a lot of friends,I play sports and I even live with my fiance.

DotA2,Let's talk about Ethereal Gems?,"Right now we have back the unusual couriers (a good stuff for skin lovers like me)

but when you destroy the little boy to use prismatic in TB arcana, techies arcana, WD padda'pon, or even in another courier, you have left the ethereal gem.

So right now there is a ton of ethereal gems lost in com. market and inventories.

What could valve do with it?

My best bet is &gt; a new open sloth in wards, since pretty much of effecets are ""eyes effects"", and wards are basically eyes, and everybody uses it, it could be a good choice.

This dont take out value/money to valve in any way, and actually there is a big chance to improve since ppl will use more market to trade it.

So is a good thing to everybody, including volvo.

what your thoughts about it?

DotA2,"Muerta chest, available after 4th?","Hey all, I'm looking to get the pudge and Io sets but I'm not sure it's possible.

I did the math and it looks like, with 0 luck, you're gonna have to spend 6 to 9 hours everyday until April 4th to have a chance at getting enough sets to trade up.

This is based on needing T2 and 3 sets.


------------


There are 6 tier 2 sets and 2 tier 3 

For trading up thats...

6 x 5 tier 1 sets = 30 tier 1 sets

2 x 5 tier 2 sets = 10 tier 2 sets

OR for trading up for every set

6 x 15 t1 sets = 90 tier 1 sets

Which is...

90 x 10 flowers each

= 900 flowers


= 225$ to open 90 chests.

On average each game of All Pick is  40 mins 

2 or 4 flowers per game

450 games with 2 flowers per game
225 games with 4 flowers per game

225 x average of 40 mins per game = 9,000mins or 150 hours

25 days left til april 4th

150 hours of play time on average divided by 25 days remaining, 6 hours of playtime per day to get every set. This is if you're getting 4 flowers EVERY game.

-----‐------

This does not take into account getting tier 2 or 3 sets spontaneously.

I'm wondering if this event is even possible in this time frame or if the chests and all their sets will be available after April 4th.",Permanent_Highschool,12/03/23 12:57:08 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/11op050/muerta_chest_available_after_4th/

DotA2,Help Me Master Leshrac,"Hi! I am a new player and after having tried a few heroes I have decides to spam leshrac in the mid role. It does not matter what the enemy team picks I always pick leshrac. I have even picked leshrac even after the enemy picked invoker, antimage and nyx in the same team. I generally prefer to pick in the 2nd phase but sometimes if I feel my team isn't going to pick and get gold penalty I just pick it. Currently I have 73 games on Leshrac with a win rate of 58.90%.

I have been trying a few things to improve. Please provide me feedback on them. Additionally you can suggest me things I can do to improve as well. These are the things I have been trying so far.

1. Last hit training with just 2 Iron Brances 
2. Click accuracy.
3. Reaction time training.
4. Watching replays of pro players and high skilled players.
5. Watching replays of my own games and reviewing them.
6. Demo hero to checking out various interactions.
7. Trying to get items within time. I check dotaprotracker to know item timings.
8. Trying to achieve a certain number of cs and networks within certain time. I use dota 2's Dotaplus to know the exact numbers.
9. Improving map awareness more by looking at the map more while I am lanning to know how the other lanes are going, who has what items. This would give me valuable information for planning ganks and estimate gank potential.(This hasn't been going well. I find it very difficult or forget to check map while I am Lanning because I am trying to outplay the opposing mid and control the lane)
10. Trying to be better at rotations. (Has improved slightly but I know i can do much better.)
11. Stacking camps while lanning so I can get neutral items for my team as soon as the time hits 7 minutes. (Hasn't been going well. I just can't seem to find the space to leave lane and when I do have the space I either forget or can't decide if it's worth it.)

To step it up and be more efficient I am thinking if trying the following:
1. Memorize bounty rune spawn timings.
2. Memorize timings of flag bearer so that I don't miss a single flag bearer in the entire game. I know they span every 1:30 minutes from the 2 minute mark but I don't know what that would translate to in time unless I calculate it on the spot 😂
3. Calculate Time taken for various movements for example how long does it take for the creep wave to reach from base to mid, calculate and memorize how long it take me to go from mid to various camps, lanes and locations with base movement speed and with various items. I feel that if I know the timings of these I can play the lane more efficiently since I know long it will take me to leave the lane to do an activity and get back to lane. So I can weigh the cost and benefit.

Please provide me feedback and let me know if I am doing things right or wrong. If you have additional feedback on how I can improve then please suggest them as well. I would be truly greatful. Thank you! 😇

So her shard/aghs will be called Coin trick (or Flourish, or something better, its a wip).

This is an active ability, ground targetted where Muerta will toss a coin in the direction you click. Now if you know the fps game ULTRAKILL, you already know where this is going. Now as, the coin travels its range, Muerta can do either if these two;
1) She can use Deadshot on the coin, as she would a unit or tree, or;
2) Auto-attack the coin.

If she does any of the two, the coin will fly and hit the nearest available target, prioritizing heroes. Maybe it crits, or deals magic damage, idc about the balance, just the concept of the ability.

Now lets make this more badass and cool to see. If you get a kill using the coin, the coin will then bounce off towards you and you can do any of the two things mentioned above.",tacideux,08/03/23 08:53:40 PM,https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/11lvmtu/aghsshard_idea_for_muerta_coin_trick_inspired_by/

Apparently, people here just use communication reports after game since you can literally report all 9 players and not use a single report submission, and it also doesn't check in-game chat/voice chat, it just deducts behaviour score.",araulo22,07/03/23 09:10:48 PM,https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/11kyz11/why_do_communication_reports_not_use_a_report/

Every hero in Dota has some sort of a weakness, or a fundamental counter. What is Arc Wardens post 25?

One of the only heroes I consistently lose against is Arc Warden. Because once he reaches 25, he just sits in fountain and throws Tempest Doubles at us. 26 second cooldown is WILD.

DotA2,Customize quick cast for items doesn't work,"I used this new screen to set certain items to quick cast, and certain other items to not quick cast. And I'm expecting these settings to hold true regardless of which item slot I put the item in. For example I want dagon to always quick cast no matter whether I put it in the top left slot, or the top right slot. And I want wards to **not** quick cast no matter whether I put it in the top left slot, or the top right slot. Is that what this feature is supposed to do or am I misunderstanding it?

Anyway, no matter what I set on that screen, it doesn't seem to have any effect. What am I doing wrong?

Edit:

I think there are some bugs that are causing problems:

1. The ""Enable Advanced Quickcast/Autocast Hotkeys"" option is interfering with the new per-item quickcast settings, preventing them from taking effect. This option is probably redundant now, and should be removed.
2. After un-checking that option, ALT and CTRL don't work for auto-casting or leveling up skills. I think this probably only affects people who previously had quickcast set up differently for each skill. (There is a way to work around this issue. See [my comment](https://old.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/11mronk/customize_quick_cast_for_items_doesnt_work/jbl3d2x/) in this thread)",NotNormo,09/03/23 09:05:07 PM,https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/11mronk/customize_quick_cast_for_items_doesnt_work/

DotA2,Dota has BKB problem,"BKB is on the most broken and core items in Dota.

Here is one suggestions . Would love to hear more.   


What if BKB was inbuilt in every hero where you get charges based on your level. You get one charge for specific level with 90 sec cool downs.   
Level 10: one 5 second charge - 90 sec cooldown

Level 12: one 6 second charge on top of unused charge. 

Level 15: one 7 second charge on top of the other unused charge

Level 19: one 8 second charge  on top of the other unused charges

Level 23: one 9 second charge  on top of the other charges

Level 27:  BKB 5 second charges always available if off cool down. This is like having a 5 second bkb today.  This is on top of any unused charges.",mndrar,08/03/23 06:51:00 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/11le7uy/dota_has_bkb_problem/
DotA2,how to climb out of solo herald?,"10 years ago I was (before medals) archon, I've gained a ton of experience since then, and become a much better player but my rank goes down no matter how hard I try in solo match, and my teammates get worse as I get better, quite literally impossible to make up for. No, I don't pay for dota+.

Over the years I've slowly fallen to lowly herald.

I tried recalibrating on a new account but my first 4 matches have all had flamers and feeders and support who intentionally throws my lane (be happy to provide match IDs because I feel HIGHLY targeted in these matches).  Like, I watch the other lanes and it seems like a normal game, pulling, stacking, harassing, warding, and one or two guys farming...then I look at my lane and it looks like something from a fucking MOBA nightmare.  4 or 5 people all competing for the same last hit/deny.  Fast forward to 20:00 minutes and there's a couple people level 20 and I'm lvl 12, unable to get a full wave of exp no matter where I rotate.  Supports literally trolling me and using me as bait.  So I go to jungle, game is basically over at this point because there's still no vision, no support in team fights I'm involved in, and no initiation from 3s 4s or 5s.

To make matters worse, there's some sort of bullshit going on where everytime I ulti, a lion shows up out of nowhere and hits me with sheep, spike, finger, and I'm dead.  It literally feels programmed like ""everytime this idiot tries to ulti we're just gonna 1 hit him with a lion hack instead""

So how the fuck do you climb out this shit?  I am much better than these matches give me credit for, I can tell by comparing myself to the other players who are actually trying, but I don't have the Moxy to keep my attitude good after hours on end of being trolled. So I just end up sitting in base with the trolls because I'd rather end 4-2-6 than 4-12-6, just dying in base repeatedly because there is no team.

What are some better heroes I can try to use to win solo games?  I typically like tanky melee DPS roles (like offlane lifestealer) or heroes with good DPS and escape like weaver and bounty hunter.  I find myself contributing to the team in huge ways, but always at my expense.  It's common for me to end a winning game with a line like 2-3-27.    My losses tend to be 1-11-11.  The team NEVER rotates, and all of a sudden it's 25 minutes and one or two people who never tried in the first place are just sitting on the fountain hording observers so we have no chance at defending t2 and t3.

How do I get out of this fucking hellscape???  PLEASE SOMEONE SAVE ME.  I want to kill myself after every match thanks to the lowlife match makers around here, and it's a game that's been in my life since war2 and I don't want to just uninstall and forget about it.  What happened to dota?  Why is it such trash now?  Why have boosters, cheaters, and smurfs made it impossible for people to climb out of herald?  I'm not some legendary player who can win 20 games in a row, especially not when it's 3v5 the whole match.  I just want to be ranked appropriately.  When I support I do it as best I can.  When others support they intentionally ruin my game and ensure we lose.

DotA2,Is anyone actually having early success with Muerta?,"Personally I don't think the hero is strong going into the mid/late game. Her spells are really good for the lane, but it ends there. She has serious issues with and not limited to:

* farming speed
* right-click based damage
* mobility

If an enemy bkbs after she ults, she LITERALLY DOES ZERO DAMAGE. I'm not taking about OD here losing a huge chunk of his pure damage to a bkb'd target as they only take his piddly physical portion, no no no, Muerta will literally do zero damage to a magic immune target during her ult. It's not a reliable source of damage, especially since it lasts such a short time. Her Q and W don't scale with items and her E doesn't really add damage to a single target, it spreads like split shot except it's only 50% of the time.

You can't really play her support because her W has such a long cd and her E and R do absolutely nothing for a support.

From what I've seen so far she's not been as impactful as other new heroes have been. I'd almost go as far as saying she's the worst new hero to ever be released.

Now please note I'm not talking about how fun she is or how interesting she is or anything of that sort. I love her hero design and her skills have some cool synergies. I'm purely talking about her weakness in that she just doesn't seem to be all that strong. My nickname for her with my buddies has been ""Mierda"".

DotA2,Muerta is a great Position 4,"I have played with Muerta players, and I have played with her myself. And a trend I see is that if you play her as a Position 1, then you have lost the game. Even mid often does great until enemies get Bkb, and then they become useless 9 times out of 10. While her ult is great for survivability, it seems wasted on a core Position right now.

As a support, you are also able to get items like Arcane Boots, which allow you to spam her abilities. And when you get cast range items, her abilities become way more useful.  

Deadshot allows you to use fear on high damage heroes for 2 seconds every 10 seconds. Since fear make enemies unable to be slowed, this makes enemies get away from fights a decent distance, that, without a movement ability, can take them out of fights for 4 seconds or so to get walk back. You can even get enemies out position by bouncing the skill on creeps, trees, or other heroes.

Her W is great at zoning out people or keeping them disabled. You place it down and if the enemy is inside, they are slowed. If they try to get out of it, they get silenced. And if they are out of it, they don't want to go inside because they get silenced and slowed. Overall, a nightmare to deal with early game, and annoying late game. It is like a worse Disruptor ult, but with a third of the cool down.

Midgame, the level 15 talent makes your deadshot shoot from half the map away. This allows you to split push safely, since you can aim trees and direct the projectile while hidden. And at level 20, when you get the second Deadshot, you can split push faster and help more in fights. 

Her playstyle feels a bit like Hoodwink's, just that you are way less mobile, but with more range with your abilities. And even then, you get a Force Staff, a Blink, or a Glimmer Cape, and you are suddenly a nightmare to catch.

While her ult and E don't add much from the support position, the built-in ghost scepter does save her having to buy it to survive. This is 1500 gold that supports have to spend often in mid game, that she doesn't. It allows her to get other items that help her team faster than other supports. It also allows her to right click physical damage carries, something a support is almost never able to do safely.

Her E, which is arguably her worst skill as a support, can help if you get lategame, after support items obviously, and build Maelstrom into Gleipnir. Then suddenly you deal a lot more damage that it's expected from a support. This, together with her ult makes her a mobile turret that the enemy Position 1 will ignore, since they can't hit her for 8 seconds. And if the enemy gets a Reventant's Brooch, or an early Bkb, then congratulations, you made the enemy core waste gold in an expensive item for a support.",Hope-end,13/03/23 10:42:57 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/11pxusg/muerta_is_a_great_position_4/

DotA2,Many of you aren't aware but DotA 2 modding permanently died this week.,"I don't know how to begin, this is just like our DotA's epic origin story, how pendragon betrayed everyone and buried many developer names. 

But either way on to the topic.

I've been using DotA 2 mods since 2016, at my first time I was really scared of knowing what will happen, since I only play on one account and I never cheated in any game online. I read many comments saying you'll get permanent ban bla bla bla none of it was true, it was like virgins giving you advice about how to do many positions without having practical knowledge and I discovered this when I dove deep into the water solo without thinking of any consequences and I'm glad I did.

From 2016 to this date I was never banned for using mods, mods are basically made of voice packs, maps, weathers, voice line, hero items, couriers, cursor etc., 

Only you can see these mods and since the beginning I remember using DotA2Mods it only had users around 700 or 750 after that it only decreased but Valve is smart even then they shutdown every modders attempt.

At first during 2020 I think the latest patch from DotA 2 dropped and it disabled all the mods, from custom mods to software called DotA2Mods and even overwolf skin changer.

But a guy named wolf later on made a software named DotA2Patcher which bypassed the Valves system and gave you re access to modding, he even unlocked DotA 2 Plus but obviously nothing paid was unlocked only helpful features like stack timing and guides were there to help to bypass paywall. But this week even he got nuked so finally there is no hope left for DotA 2 modding and everyone just has to play plain and simple DotA 2.

Some people think modding is unfair because it unlocks your items skins for free but I mostly used custom sets made by the creators, such as Blizzard pandaren brewmaster as storm spirit. 

Plus only you could see these sets so it didn't affect the steam economy.",Zealousideal_Cry5914,11/03/23 09:59:40 PM,https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/11okvvs/many_of_you_arent_aware_but_dota_2_modding/

Problem: her dagger, good for farming early game, but the down side: when ganking, it gives the enemy a signal: hey, PA is HERE, RUN.....So most of the time when I jump on sups, I don't even cast dagger, to get that extra surprise 1-second timer... which is also in-efficient on another aspect: I need to slow the enemy and do the dagger damage as well, cast time is high (wasting half a second).

So my suggestion:Dagger auto cast: works only when PA is under blur, once PA blinks on a target, she casts the dagger with 0 cast time (melee range), muted cast sound.

DotA2,Valve had no right removing Techies from the game,"The people who changed Goblin Techies into its current form, had no right to do so. Techies is DOTA. In the same way Pudge is DOTA and Chen is DOTA. This game, and the characters in it have existed for literally twenty years at this point guys. Yes in that time things have changed, but you know what hasn't changed? Phantom Lancer gets his illusions. Pudge gets his hook. Mirana gets her arrow. Bloodseeker gets Rupture. Axe spins. 

There has never been a patch in the history of this game, that fundamentally changes a hero. If a patch came out tomorrow that removed Omni from Jugg everyone in this community would shit a brick. If they removed Snipe from FUCKING SNIPER, YOU WOULD BE A BIT ANNOYED. So why the FUUUCK is this community ok with what they did to Techies?

Put how god awfully annoying he could be to play into aside. Seriously, every hero in this game is annoying in their own special, unique way. Techies was its own special nightmare. But it was SPECIAL. So special in fact, that when he was introduced into the game it was a BIG DEAL because a lot of people didn't think the game was truly DOTA until Techies was here. It would be like if Pudge never came out. 

I mostly play 2 Heroes. Huskar and Techies. I like to switch between ""get in there"" games and ""I am Jigsaw and this is Saw"" games. I had to quit playing when they changed Techies. I tried to keep playing, but they literally deleted him and replaced it with this weird character that has no real flare. I recently have tried to rejoin the game, and I am finding it really hard. I have been branching out and playing more heroes but I can't help but have this bad taste in my mouth towards Valve, and their team.

If Techies wasn't properly balanced you should have done your jobs better, not removed him. It's as simple as that. If your solution to a character that is 20 years old, is to delete it because you personally can't figure out how to balance it, you are objectively bad at what you do and should resign. This is as asinine as making a Scooby Doo show without Scooby Doo. Either be good at what you do, or get out of the way so people who can handle it can fix your mistakes. 

His SUICIDE doesn't even SUICIDE anymore. You do realize how stupid this whole situation is right? 

And in regards to the pro scene and his value there. I don't give a fuck. Who gives a fuck about pro gamers? I literally do not know if techies was good or bad in pro games. All I know is that I got to Divine with him as my mid pick, so I thought he was pretty great. But if you are focusing all of your balance around the highest of tiers of gameplay, and not, you know, THE VAST MAJORY OF GAMEPLAY, then maybe you are doing it poorly?

DOTA is 20 years old. The people working on this game are not the architects they are the stewards. They have a duty to maintain the game, and removing Techies was the antithesis to this. I just assumed Icefrog wasn't involved in the game anymore when that change came out, because its so anti-DOTA. If Techies remote mine nightmare style of gameplay, was so game destroying, why have we been playing this for 20 years? 

A fucking TAZER? Go fuck yourselves seriously? A Tazer? A Tazer? I used to build fucking nuclear weapons and you gave me a Tazer? Go fuck yourselves you game design hacks. A Tazer.

I had a strategy I would call ""There shouldn't be mines there"". It was my favorite. I would sit on my highground and spam a stack of remotes, and send them down mid. Then announce to my team, ""Time for Operation There Shouldn't Be Mines There"". Then my babies would migrate across the river, and wait near their T2 spot, because, there shouldn't be mines there. Then BOOM. Delicious every time.

A FUCKING TAZER. 

Mid techies was so fire. The goal of mid Techies is to never leave lane. All you do is mine up the mid lane, defend your tower, and push. As you push down through the map you make safe rooms in the trees, and then additional trap spots as you run down the river. As long as you never lose your mid T1 its actually very difficult to lose the game as your team then gets really good map control. You use this to take their Ancients, and if the enemy team tries to stop you, they have to fight in your nightmare town.

DotA2,Meteor Hammer,"Are you tired of losing games in Dota 2? Do you want to climb the ranks and become a pro player? Well, I have the solution for you: Meteor Hammer.

Yes, you heard it right. Meteor Hammer is the best item in the game, and you should buy it every single game, regardless of your hero or role. Playing support? Get Meteor Hammer. Playing offlane? Get Meteor Hammer. Playing mid? Get Meteor Hammer. Playing carry? Get Meteor Hammer.

Some may argue that it's a situational item, but I say that every situation is a Meteor Hammer situation. Need to defend your high ground? Meteor Hammer. Need to secure Roshan? Meteor Hammer. Need to clear out creep waves? Meteor Hammer. I have never lost a game where I bought Meteor Hammer, and I never will.

DotA2,"Game Freezes when I do the first tutorial ""Basic Mechanics""","I just recently installed DOTA 2 and was attempting to finish the new player area of the game. On the first tutorial ""Basic Mechanics"" it freezes every time I return to the fountain when it asks me to return so that I may use the shop. All animations freeze but I am still able to pan my camera around the map.  
Below is a pic of my PC specs along with a picture of where the game freezes, and my graphics card is a Radeon RX 570 Series. My PC and my drives are up to date. I have the game run with -autoconfig -high -windowed, in case that is something you are wondering about. I would really like to know why its freezing and if it can be fixed.

DotA2,The New Chest in DOTA is Unrealistic to Complete Without Grinding full time for Over a Month,"Hey fellow DOTA players,

I don't know about you, but I love collecting cosmetics in DOTA. So, when I heard about the new chest, I was excited to get my hands on all the items. However, after doing some calculations, I found out that it's practically impossible for anyone with a day job to grind for all the cosmetics in the new chest.

According to my calculation, it takes 41 days and 8 hours of playing DOTA for 45 minutes each game to grind for all the cosmetics in the chest. As someone who can only enjoy 1 or 2 games a day, I find this really frustrating.

I understand that the new chest is supposed to be a challenge, but why make it so unrealistic for players who have other commitments in life? I strongly suggest that the game designers allow all the sets and chest to be marketable at least like the Diretide event. After all, the event itself is only a month-long.

What are your thoughts on this? Do you think it's fair for players to have to grind for over a month to get all the cosmetics from the new chest?

DotA2,FPS &amp; Variable refresh rate unable to sync,"I recently bought Gigabyte G24F-2 monitor. FreeSync is enabled and Gsync under NVCP is also enabled for my RTX 2060. Monitor has 165hz refresh rate. The problem is whenever my fps drops below the max refresh rate, I face tearing plus micro stuttering which really annoys me and makes the game feel not so smooth. VRR is working and I have checked it via OSD RR counter and also via G-sync indicator.

Freesync doesn't seem to fulfill its purpose which is to match the refresh rate with my current fps which isn't dropping below 100 by any means so I am well in FreeSync/G-sync range.

The fps counter and refresh rate counter seems to mismatch which seems to cause tearing plus micro stuttering. I have already tried;

1. FreeSync + Vsync ON
2. FreeSync + Vsync ON + Frame limiter (-3 cap)
3. FreeSync + Vsync OFF + Frame limiter (-3 cap)
4. FreeSync + Vsync ON + Nvidia reflex boost

Actually everything that's been guided on BlurBuster forums but FPS and RR doesn't seem to match once the FPS drops below my max refresh rate. Not sure if this issue is specific to Dota 2 or not.

Gotta try on MW tomorrow but again it should work with Dota as well. Please help if anyone have overcome this issue.

Do people actually believe that? I mean just the reliable and unreliable gold mechanic is an obvious change to make the game less punishing to mistakes. Way easier to farm and way less gold need to be spent with extra items (free wards, free couriers, free tps).

DotA2,Build Assault Cuirass on Muerta carry as second item,"She benefits a ton from the attack speed but also the armor, which is something she severely lacks as a non agi carry. Strength right clickers like WK, LS, Sven, DK, Alch, LC, and CK all buy this item as well, and it is good on Muerta for similar reasons. On Muerta it also has the bonus of allowing her to siege way faster than most other heroes with the item since her passive allows her to hit a building twice in one attack. Add the -armor on top of that and she becomes a super effective siege hero on par with a hero like Morphling. Also, the value of having extra armor in fights can't be understated. Other int core heroes already buy shivas since they lack armor. Muerta is another int hero that needs more armor, so just build AC.  


Witch blade also gives armor and attack speed but I think it is not nearly as good as AC. First off, she still needs 3-4 items to be at her max strength, and going witch blade won't get you there any faster since she still isn't the best at killing heroes early. Second, there isn't a ton of value in upgrading it to revenants brooch later in the game since she can already do the same thing but better with her ult. Also, the value of having the extra 25% slow from an attack is of objectionable value on Muerta since she can already slow by 30% with her W and fear in any direction with her Q. (Another interesting note is that witch blades damage and slow will not activate on heroes hit by an extra shot from her passive. However, if you upgrade to revenants brooch then it can activate in this way. In that way, upgrading it is actually a downgrade.)

Sure, that's true, but honestly, the game has gotten *a lot* more forgiving as well, along with some major power creep. Just a few examples:

- Regen stuff like Salves and Clarities used to get cancelled by creeps. You used to have to be very careful with how and when you used them. Nowadays you can just use them without worries.

- Heroes used to have way less efficient skills. Take Wraith King for example, his skeletons allow him to farm a lot faster. He didn't have that, it was just a normal lifesteal. 

- Heroes have overall gotten a *lot* tankier. I watched a game where a Mushi Storm Spirit had BKB and Linkens and was lvl 20, he had 1400 HP. Nowadays, Storm Spirit can easily get to 2K+ hp pre lvl 15. 

- Single courier for everyone, no free items shipped to you in lane all the time.

- No backpack, no dedicated slot for TP scroll. 1 slot in your inventory was always reserved for TP scroll.

There is much more, but you get the picture.

After the last patch 7.32e, this notification disappeared from the list, and now I can't pick up the remaining rewards, including the identity on phantom assasin and two arcana on razor and faceless void, I wrote to steam support, the answer was that they can't add the uncollected rewards to my account, now I'm very sorry for this, I could not pick them up myself, since I was in the hospital for almost 2 months. I think that I am not the only one who has encountered such a problem, I hope you will answer here and perhaps help draw the attention of developers to this problem, thank you in advance.",MAXIMUS_ELITE,08/03/23 07:57:36 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/11lfyij/inability_to_receive_battle_pass_2022_rewards/

&amp;#x200B;

**According to the comments below, some people may have some misconceptions about Chinese Dota 2, which I clarify here:**

* China's Dota 2 has been on a **downward trend** since the beginning of TI9. **Rich guys** may find it hard to imagine ,due to the poor professional competition system and  the inaction of PerfectWorld and Valve, **the fact that Chinese Dota 2 is likely to die out in the coming years**
* &gt;!Less and less Chinese capital will choose to invest in Chinese teams, and young Chinese professionals, even if they waste a few years of their youth, will not receive enough salary to pay their rent and get a better life.!&lt;
* In fact, according to what Chalice said, in the future, **the Chinese DPC** may even have a ridiculous situation where **the S-level league** cannot even make up 8  strong teams.
* Of course, the most important point to note is that Chalice himself **should be against match-fixing**, but he complains more about the current professional environment is so bad that **Chinese Dota 2 esports is starting to die.**",Full-Government2373,09/03/23 04:44:39 PM,https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/11mn7kn/regarding_the_fake_match_the_famous_chinese/

DotA2,Premute experience question,"I am curious why we have premute system and communication report option. I think that the ages gone since mute functionality introduced. Aren't it enough to just press one button if someone disrupts you in game?

When you lost 5+ games in a row even the kindest person can melt and say something. All people are different, we can be brilliant at one thing and very bad in other (for example game) and obviously anyone can loose his temper. I am not the kindest but not the rudest.Most of my gaming experience I had 9k+ behavior. And know I have premute for a month that was chained with some lights off led to abandons and low priority. Can it be chained more than month, eternity?

How the system tracks that communication report was legit? As I know voice data aren't stored. What if 4 people in team just don't like the 5th and send him 4 reps and for example 2 games in a row. I even deleted the hotkey from microphone for some time and still got reports for communication.I have been playing dota since 2014 and have some experience in dota 1, but communication became a problem only half a year before. Do you really think that I've changed for that time?)) Or maybe something with a controversial functionality that allow people to send a random reports on you just for fun, when they play in ranked game and don't even want to win (I will not go over a quality of game on low mmr bracket).

Why we need then premute if we have a mute?)  
Wish you all good games and teammates (\^\_\^)

P.S. Check players on premute at the game start please, not everyone there are on purpose. I had a game with 3 premutes and they played really good and shared useful info in game.

Centaur who blinks + stomps

Tide who blinks + ult

Some chinese dotaer then go to  retire player(like Ame or Maybe) live room ask them  attitude about the Knights maybe used cheat on dota2,alomst retire player just watched the replay and said it's possible used cheat.But on Maybe live room,he  straight ask Knights.Felixciaoba whether or not used cheat,then Felixciaoba said him didn't used retire,finally maybe said  believed him,Maybe because they were  teammate on RNG.

After Valve Ban Knights all team,now have so many chinese dotaer go to Maybe's live room  attack or blame Maybe and told him need to apologize about this thing.Maybe  fight back and said something attack these dotaer：said these dotaer is loser, ask why he need to apologize.....

Now on chinese  dota2 community,about 80% post about this thing.

Some people support maybe,but almost all people blame Maybe attack these dotaer.

Then the turtle team usually wins the fight and now its the other team turtling. Thus a never ending cycle is born and late game is just extremely exhausting and boring.

DotA2,Arc Warden rework idea.,"Hello dota players (and devs...maybe?),

Arc used to be my most spammed hero a few years back, when physical attack build was viable and very potent if mastered properly. The current aghs octarine spell casting build feels so boring and honestly not fun at all. I propose to remove the spark wraith spell and give him a new unique passive.

This passive would work when arc uses his ult. Imagine that initially arc would be neutral charged/not charged. When he uses ult, he will splits into two units, one would be positively charged (original hero) and the other would be negative (the clone). Every time the original hero hits an enemy unit the enemy gets a positive charge debuff. Basically a counter on how many times the positive hero has hit the enemy. Similarly, for every autoattack the negative hero lands, the enemy get a negative charge counter. This debuff doesn't do anything on its own and expires after a while, it comes into effect only when the other unit hits the enemy as well. If the enemy is hit by the clone after being recently hit by the original, both the +ve and -ve charge would cancel, the positive counter will reduce by one, and would do bonus damage. As you can see, if both the orig hero and the clone are hitting the same target, then they would dish out serious damage, as compared to them fighting separately.

This passive along with the 50% damage reduction and the lack of spark wraiths would incentivise the players to stand and fight in a teamfight and not hide in the trees to cast spark wraiths like a pussy. Might as well help discourage people from using the clone to push sidelanes/rat while a teamfight is happening.

Thoughts ?

TLDR: Remove spark wraith; Add new passive. If both the orig hero and clone hit the same target, do extra damage.",RadioactiveSalt,10/03/23 04:35:10 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/11n2zfk/arc_warden_rework_idea/
DotA2,After 20 Muerta Games...,"After 15+ turbos and 5 matches as Muerta, I have to say she is pretty fun and unique, deadshot is skill based and fun asf, the calling is a pretty interesting control and farming spell (tho lame in 1v1 or early fights) and her passive one of the best farming and fighting spells (1v1 with the passive feels so good) and her ult imo is okay as it is. You just have to time it, since she is still capable of dealing much damage without ult.


Overall she's pretty fun and unique and it feels so good to play such a new different hero, she definitely needs some tweaks and touches not saying she's perfect. I believe low movement speed is her main problem, and attack speed another tho not sure if she needs more atk speed.

DotA2,thoughts on muerta and tricks. part 2,"this is my second post on this and I'm just trying to share my experience as muerta in different teams against different enemies. just a heads-up i am still testing pos 2 muerta and I'm crusader 2, mainly pos 1 but my rotations as pos 2 aren't that bad.

anyways, here are my second thoughts and builds i tried:

as mid last time i played went for witchblade and it felt really bad. this item provided 0 value imo probably an easy to avoid item. last night i started testing out a new build which was botte treads into midas maelstrom d lance and bkb. first i thought if i keep my distance with d lace i won't need bkb as much at that stage, i am sort of correct bc tbh my main problem as muerta atm is i pop my ult but I'm not able to hit my enemies. they are faster than me or have mobility item. one game enemy had es and he just fissure me out which was painful.


the build i tried last night allowed me to have a good nw while being active on the map, however i feel like i lacked mobility that's why i want to try out a new build tonight. my thoughts are she needs blink for sure, somewhat similar to ta. maybe she can go for boots of travel to be evasive on map and split push but either way here's what i think will work better as pos 2 for muerta :

imma build bottle pt into a casual gloves of haste after d lance and maybe windlace too. after i can build blink into bkb and then e blade works, pike works, glepnir works but it's kinda too expensive so I'm not sure. swift blink etc. i feel like i will lack attackspeed but will have to see

also i went for 414 skill build which wasn't as useful in fights as i thought it would (hit enemies twice) but rather the more silence and as rd on w might have been better




strategies while playing mid which makes her such an annoying hero to deal with:

one thing you should be aware of is that when you fear enemies tehy turn into a racing car and run as fast as they can. i always let enemy mid come past the river, fear using enemy ranged to fear enemy towards my towrr and cast w so that he has to walk it back all the way or get some more tower hits/walk to thr side of river which allows you to hit more. they are in no position to fight trust me. i keep doing this and ut fucks up the enemies",ShickenButt,09/03/23 03:17:38 PM,https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/11mlsi6/thoughts_on_muerta_and_tricks_part_2/

DotA2,Muerta cannot be banned?,"Me and my friend like to do a scummy thing as soon as the patch is released; we queue into games and ban the new hero. Very scummy, negative-karma-inducing behaviour, I'm aware. However we only do this in turbo as the ban rate is 100%, and only for like 2 games after the new patch.

Recently, we played all pick and had a bunch of Muerta pickers in every game. It started to get annoying when I realized none of them know what they're doing and are just trying to play the new hero. I get it, new patch, new fun hero to explore, and I've done the same thing where I queue just to play the new hero. But with Muerta it felt extra awful cause the hero is useless if you don't build it right, so we decided enough Muertas on our team, let's try to ban her. First few games she didn't get banned, we said ""oh well, rng"". But after 20+ games or so, we noticed she never got banned, and when one of us tried to pick her to get the hero banned, it always locked in, or it gave it to the enemy who just picked her. So apparently, nominating her for a ban does nothing, and picking her at the same time as someone else also does nothing.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Muerta cannot be banned in all pick, and two guys picking her (on opposite teams) results in the game giving her to the first picker.

&amp;#x200B;

Do you guys think this is a bug or intended behaviour from valve. As, perhaps, they want the hero to be played in as many games as possible to collect data on her?",bupher,10/03/23 01:47:59 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/11mym4x/muerta_cannot_be_banned/

DotA2,Esports Survey Research,"Hello DotA2 community,

I’m a current PhD student at Florida State University. I am conducting a survey based research study for my degree requirements about esports players. The study has received approval from the Institutional Review Board at Florida State University. I’m posting on here to find participants for my survey research.

I’m seeking esports players over the age of 18 in the United States. If you meet this criteria and currently play Defense of the Ancients 2, then you are eligible to participate in this study! You do not need to be a current member of an esports team to be eligible.

I am interested to find out the mental performance strategies that esports players use in practice and competition settings. I want to investigate the attitudes and expectations esports players have towards performance/sport psychology consulting services. An important note: participants do not need to have previous experience using a performance psychology consultant to participate in this study.

This study involves an online survey that takes about 30-35 minutes to complete. Participants can provide their email at the end of the survey if they are interested to receive a synopsis of the data results once the study is completed, as well as the opportunity to be entered into a raffle to win one of three $50.00 Amazon gifts cards.

There is minimal psychological or physical risk associated with participation in the study. Participants answers will be kept anonymous.

You can participate by accessing the Qualtrics survey here:

DotA2,Interview with GG.dyrachyo (translation from Russian),"*Disclaimer: this interview was taken before the Major but was released just now. I also skipped some parts of it so don’t be confused because of the weird question order.* Original video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Do0yfnIpHOE&amp;t&amp;ab\_channel=KDALLIN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Do0yfnIpHOE&amp;t&amp;ab_channel=KDALLIN)

*PS: I just liked this interview and wanted to share it here so you can know more about Anton. Also it’s my first time translating anything and English is not my first language so I’m sorry if there’re any mistakes \^\_\^*

**Q: Tell us how was it for you to play BetBoom Universe Tournament? What went wrong?**  
A: We played against Entity, then we had 2 days of break because there was stuff to do, we didn’t play scrims and we probably lost our spirit. We barely played Dota those days so that’s why we lost.

**Q: Didn’t you expect this? You didn’t practice and noone played so..**

A: Well someone played but not that much. Idk, it doesn’t matter, no one really cared about it tbh.

**Q: When Topson entered lobby were you scared?**

A: Nah, I didn’t care.

Q: Didn’t care but lost.

A: Yeah we lost, unlucky.

**Q: Overall, this period after TI, the Major hasn’t started yet, what do you think was it a successful run? (about first DPC tour)**

A: Well, we got what we expected. We got 2nd place, we planned to qualify to Major, doesn’t matter from which place. I think we had enough power for that.

**Q: What about BetBoom Xmas Show Tournament? They played it without you and won. Was there any pressure for you?**

A: No, I didn’t care I was chilling.

**Q: Were you happy for them or you would prefer them to lose so they understand it’s better to play with you?**

A: Nah, ofc I was happy for them. They won, it gave them confidence before DPC. I was chilling anyway no pressure. Got my money anyway for the 2 games I played, we’ll share it (laughs).

**Q: How was your vacation?**

A: Good, saw my mom for the first time this year. We spent time out together, I was just shopping and spending money.

**Q: There’s not much new from your mom recently, not as much as it was at TI. Doesn’t she wanna hype?**

A: Idk, she writes something in comments but they don’t post it anywhere. And she always texts me, she always watches my games.

**Q: What does she text you?**

A: She just cheers for me and wishes good luck. She really watches all of my games.

**Q: How did Quinn get into the team?**

A: Really good, we all welcomed him into the team. Seleri knew him already for some time, they often played mafia on LANs and communicated a lot. He is what we needed tbh – confidence in our midlaner who can carry the game if needed, you know that even if he loses his lane – he knows what to do and he has some plan on game in general, he knows his signatures, his heroes power peak. Just game calls from midlaner to come for rune, play mid and other stuff, that’s what we missed.

**Q: What do you think is the secret of success for your team?**

A: Well I think we’re passionate to Dota, we always talk about the game, about heroes, drafts, always discuss something and I guess that’s the secret. We have burning desire to play. Noone burns out and everyone has a specific goal – to win, to qualify to TI, to get good results at tournaments and spend this year better than the last one. Also, we believe in ourselves and treat each other good, outside and inside the game.

**Q: How do you like to watch Quinn’s pubs from the front row?**

A: I didn’t really watch tbh. You can hear sometimes what he’s saying but actually he improved a lot. He doesn’t play with ruiners from NA anymore. I think he has a better team now, I hope he thinks so too (laughs). He can only work on his mentality now, mechanically he’s really good, he presses buttons good, stands his lane good.

**Q: Do you work with psychologist?**

A: No, I don’t think that we need it. Maybe he (Quinn) used to sigh and tilt, but it’s better now. Everyone has his own area of responsibility and I think it’s easier for him too that he’s only responsible for his lane. He played with noobs before, didn’t trust them and he had to do game calls too much, then something goes wrong and he gets mad.

**Q: All the teams who won last TIs said in their interview that psychologist helped them a lot.**

A: I think it’s individual for everyone. Someone needs and someone doesn’t. Psychologist can only help you to deal with pressure, get you ready for the game, help you not to think about what surrounds you and that’s all. Idk how can he help in game itself.

**Q: Why did you change your coach and what are the differences between the old one and new one?**

A: New coach is more chill kinda guy. He’s not like your boss, he’s more like adviser. Our previous coach was some kind of authoritarian, we had to do everything according to his plan. He did drafts on his own, but now we do drafts as a team, everyone communicates. Previous coach has his own plan on game so we didn’t have some kind of flexibility. We had a plan and we were obliged to do it or at least try our best. Now we play like we have 5 skilled players and everyone understands what best he can do in game. Our coach, Ace and Seleri do the drafts now. Coach can advise something but not like we must take what he says.

**Q: So you barely interact with your coach?**

A: No I mean he can advise something but inside the game not that often. More like players can help me in game, give some build advices, for example Ace can give some advices because he used to play as carry. In general everyone can help each other, we all communicate.

**Q: Who will fly with your team from GG org this time?**

A: I think a lot of people again, Calvin, Shawn, Alex. They all cheering for us, always support us. The most positive guy is Calvin for sure, he really gives you good vibes and you can feel his support, he makes you feel confident, if something is bad - he always helps. Also ReshyD, he’s very nice guy, always energetic, it’s always nice to talk to him.

**Q: Does the circle of you friends consist of the players you used to play with?**

A: Yeah, actually I talk to them pretty often, we get along well and I don’t have any conflicts with them, I’m not a conflict person.

**Q: I can make a conflict right now. Nikita “Pantomem” said you’re ruining his pubs.**

A: (laughs) Well yeah happens. I don’t ruin only his pubs, we played in party and ruined together. I keep in touch with him well, we’re friends. Also Yamich from Winstrike even though we had some conflicts in team. I keep in touch with everyone tbh. I actually chat with Russian players more than with EU guys. I mostly talk with my team only on bootcamp or sometimes in Discord but not on full-time. Sometimes I can talk with guys from Team Liquid who I know or Tundra and TSM but only on LANs.

**Q: How did you get in Gaimin Gladiators?**

A: I texted them and they took me. We played a bit and they took me right away. Idk we got along maybe they liked how I play.

**Q: Why did text exactly them?**

A: Who should I've texted to? I didn’t know who to write to. I just liked how Seleri played and I texted him, and they already had a ground for the team – coach, Seleri and midlaner. And we got 3rd and 4th position.

**Q: Didn’t you text anyone else that time?**

A: No I only texted them because it’s my first EU team, I don’t have much experience, no feedback so who would take me. I don’t even remember which variants did I have. I just liked the player, texted him and they took me.

**Q: How was it for you being in EU team for the first time?**

A: Well at the beginning it was unusual, but in general I liked how people worked, how they treated the game and communicated. I enjoyed it and now I’ve been playing with them for more than year already and I really like it.

**Q: But you said that you don’t talk a lot with your team outside the bootcamp and game. Don’t you think that you fall out of general team vibe?**

A: Not at all, I think on LANs I’m always with my guys and I definitely don’t fall out of the team. Everyone has his own life, I can sometimes talk in Discord but not permanently. I think we’re more like colleagues. I think only Ace and tOfu are always together, they’re like true friends because they’ve been playing with each other for so long. They always play pubs in party and also Diablo. But everyone has his own friends from their cities and they spend time together so I think I’m okay with it.

**Q: So you come in Dota, you all are motivated, ready to work, you do your job and then everyone does his own business.**

A: Yeah, but if we’re on LAN we can go out to restaurants, just hang out, everyone is up for it if we have time. We spent a lot of time together in Singapore, we have a good vibe.

**Q: Who do you think will compete with you at Major?**

A: I think PSG.LGD, Team Liquid, BetBoom and maybe Team Spirit. SA for sure. Actually, there are many good teams. This patch last so long and everyone knows how to play, all meta heroes so I think it will be hard on the first Major, but for the second Major meta will change, new patch and it will be more interesting. No OG at Major so we have no one to lose (laughs). Because we lost to OG twice.

**Q: Were you stressing after TI about the roster changes?**

A: No, we discussed with guys immediately that we don’t wanna continue playing with BOOM and coach. Ace, tOfu and Seleri made decision about coach, I didn’t really care actually but I guess it’s better like that because we became more flexible and the atmosphere is more chill now.

**Q: You started playing Dota in 2013, where were you studying meanwhile?**

A: At school, I finished 11th grade, then summer, my mom told me to continue studying, I studied 2 days then I said no I don’t want to, I wanna play. 2 months later I was in team already. My mom didn’t control me very hard, she’s calm. I always had freedom of actions, she trusts me. I just played games all the time. She said if it not works out (become a pro player) then you’ll get a normal job like that’s your life – your decision. I had like a year to become a pro, I had money on life only for one year or something. But fortunately I got success almost right away. Tbh I can’t even imagine myself working at normal job.

**(About Serbia and Belgrade)**

I’ve moved to Belgrade since June. There’s one minus I can say about Serbia is the food delivery. I like the climate, prices.. no not cevapi. I like the place where I live, I have friends there but the food gets boring very quickly. Idk at one day you just can’t eat the same food. In Moscow you can order any homemade food you want but in Serbia it’s really hard especially quality food. There’re also problems with taxi, sometimes you need to wait an hour or more. (About his apartment) The rent is the same 1k€, but I don’t mind paying this price because my apartment is really good so it’s worth it. It’s better than if I lived somewhere where I would not be satisfied with my place. The background matters for me.

also the patch is good and Valve is been transparent, people are just to stupid and have to high expectations.. i always sad when this type of things happen in Dota, bc we blame Valve a lot (and yes we have the rights) but they made fantastic job in Dota compared to the ""others"".. 

a current video game company they just would censure those who speak ill of them and literally dont give a fuck and people stay happy with the shit that they play, luckily the Dota IP is in the hands of Valve and they respond to the community we should be more comprehensive they are small team, i dont give a fuck that Valve is a multi millionaire company they still a super small team compared to the normal standard and also they are humans and they have feeling.

DotA2,Muerta is a support hero,"I played and experimented with Muerta quite a lot and I believe she’s a SUPPORT hero at best. Her 45.27% winrate prob is from how she is not fully utilized and is played in the wrong position. Here’s how I play her:

Dead Shot:
Her Q can bounce off trees (cuts the tree upon hit) and enemies and will stop till it hits a Hero. It gives vision which is okay. I use this primarily to stack to camps in one go which is great. Range is okay and scales well in late game. The bounce off something makes the range great. Pretty good disruptor for melee units and can be used for farming if needed. Can also use to cancel skills/ults (those annoying  Lion drain, Bara charges, LC duel). Attack modifier procs with this skill so use that as well. This skill is pretty annoying if you get it down right.

The Calling:
It slows atk and movespeed inside its area and silences units hit by the circling remnants (also deals damage). This is an okay skill. What’s bad is that it has terrible cast range to be really good. Synergizes okay with Q skill to get that silence in. I use this primarily for the silence (hit em with the remnant right away). Can also use to create space or control back lines.

Gunslinger:
Passive skill which allows you to hit two targets. Pretty straight forward passive.

Pierce The Veil:
Immune to Physical damage. I pretty much just use this as an escape skill from physical carries.


Core items is pretty much just Arcane Boots, Aether Lens (Octarine) and Force Staff (save/reposition) then whatever your team needs. She’s an INT hero so some support items benefit her right click.

Win rate is taken from [dotabuff.com](https://dotabuff.com) from the last month. Since the new patch just arrived that was probably not so smart but you cannot choose Patch 7.32e as a time sadly.

I will update win rates once we are a fully week into Patch 7.32e.

**Big take aways (not serious):**

* Always buy Wraith Bands of the 3 starting items
* Always buy Yasha&amp;Kaya of the 3 upgrades (Kaya, Sange, Yasha)
* Always upgrade to Overwhelming Blink
* Rapier is the best item in the game by far
* Only Boots of Travel 2 or Boots of Bearing are above average boots so don't bother with other boots
* Always upgrade your Stick to Holy Locket
* Moon Shard is the best damage item after Rapier so go Rapier into Moonshard for free MMR
* BKB is below average so Crusaders were right to never buy that shit
* Use Aghanim's Blessing early it has higher win rate than Aghanim's Scepter
* Supports should always buy Veil of Discord or Meteor Hammer or both as they are the best cheap items
* Only buy Midas or Battle Furry for farming if you think you will sell them before the game ends",LeNigh,08/03/23 10:35:19 PM,https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/11lxx7g/item_win_rate_over_item_prices_for_fully_upgraded/

DotA2,"Dude, I LOVE the new heroes design/concept","I know everybody is kinda disappointed that we didn’t get dota 2 8.00 + v2 the remix ft. IceFrog. But something that I think is going under the radar is that Muerta is the 11th 100% original dota 2 hero 
You probably don’t remember but I make [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/o98fuo/valve_we_need_a_new_monster_hero/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) years back. Asking for more diversity on the hero department, and when I say diversity I don’t  mean more human races. If we are on a magical planet with hundreds of magical races. Then why I am playing a dude with a sniper rifle (sniper)vs another dude with a sword  (Jugernaut) ?
Let me be a huge Interdimensional space monster  ( OD) vs a Native American shaman ( Shadow Shaman )
I think the last 3 hero’s has been incredible on the concept and design for example :

-Marci : This is probably a kinda controversial opinion but Marci has a pretty cool concept despite being ‘just a human’ 
On all my life I have NEVER played a character that is mute. This is some next lever shit inclusion for a whole community that has been kinda forgotten. And the fact that’s is just a ‘ little cute girl ‘ whose ultimate ability is literally just beat the shit out of you is pretty cool . 

-Primal Beast : A FUXKING DINOSAUR
This is what I am talking about. I want to play a giant dino that just goes all in on the battlefield trampling everyone. And I love that the gameplay is literally that, you go all in with your Q, and start tramping everyone with your W. Is a giant dinosaur looking monster, you WANT to just go nuts with it and that’s why the hero’s gameplay is design like this. 

-Muerta: How the fuck did you combine Mexican culture, cowboys and ghosts and somehow make it work so great ?  It’s looks sicks and you can see again how the design affects the gameplay. 
Cowboys are famous because of his skills with guns right ? Then let’s make that her Q is a skill shoot. 
And what ? Ghost scares you to the point that you can’t talk ? Then let’s make that she summons ghosts that’s silences you . 
And the Cherry on top, she is a Carry of course, but she is a INT carry, something that is kinda new for the meta if we forget the LINA MAJOR. 

I can just keep sucking a balls deep valve on this post about how cools is the hero seeing in general lately. How for example that of they wanted to Create a hero that can turn into a ball and roll  ( Pangolier ) they could have chosen a hedgehog to base the hero. But they choose a Pangolin, and animal that can do exactly the same, but it’s not as famous as and is an Endangered species. You get my point 

Valve please, go nuts with the next hero’s, make a NOT HUMANOID machine created by an ancient race  ( like those giants on the movie Atlantis ) that is no longer here.

I don't know if this issue is common with other players, or even if there is a solution (if there is please let me know) but figured I would bring it up to see if anyone else has this problem, or can offer a solution  


Edit:  The reason for doing this is to make it easier to press certain  abilities, and to do certain wombo combos on specific heroes. Great  example being Naga Siren. Her E is Rip tide, which is a passive;  completely useless considering E is prime finger real estate. She also  has a scepter ability, Reel In which makes all heroes in her Ensnare 'W'  get reeled into her. Swap Rip Tide (E) and Reel In and you got a  Ensnare (W) &gt; Reel In (E) mini wombo right there.

DotA2,I think Muerta is perfect!! Except for a tiny nitpick with a voice line.,"Her line when she kills Snapfire that says ""Quien a hierro mata a hierro muere"" is really cool. It means ""They who kill with iron die by iron"", but the pronunciation is wrong! The double r in hierro has to be rolled hard, but when muerta says it it sounds like ""hiero"" and it completely kills the line.

There are other examples where she rolls the r's perfectly so I am sure it was just a small issue with direction perhaps.

Could it be possible to get the actress to repeat that line and run it again? Muerta is literally perfect otherwise, and having her spanish be wrong feels like a big oversight that crushes the vibe of the character, even if it's just for a very tiny moment.

If there's anyone at valve reading I hope you guys can do a tiny edit for this! It would make Muerta completely flawless in my eyes.

**Update: Apparently it got fixed as of the most recent patch!! Thank you so much for everyone at valve who worked on this character and to whoever managed to change this in such short notice!

DotA2,Does playing unranked with a friend (who is playing on their own acc that's new to dota) mess with ranked matches?,"I have gone from 2.6k to 3.3k in the span of a month since my mmr deprecated due to not playing for a few months. Getting back to 4k has been relatively easy, until I played a few matches with a friend who is new to dota. After we played, I have had \~10-15 dogshit matches of ranked in a row, where I've lost 250 mmr overall. Tonight alone, I had two different matches where my mid abandoned the game by 12 minutes in without saying anything. I have had matches where people do not play the roles they selected and I've had multiple matches where there were clearly smurfs (usually on the enemy team, but they have been on mine as well) despite that not happening at all before playing with my friend. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is probably subconscious bias in some way, but I swear I'm baffled by the consistency and immediacy of the loss of quality in my ranked matches.

DotA2,I made a website for finding Dota 2 teammates,"[TeamTavern](https://www.teamtavern.net/games/dota2) is an esports team finding platform which supports Dota 2. It saves you the trouble of searching through forums, Discord servers and message boards to find people to play with.

## Who is this for?

TeamTavern is both for dedicated players and teams aiming to be the best in the game as well as for casual players and groups looking for new friends to enjoy the game with. Whether you are a single player looking for a team or a group looking for players, TeamTavern is your online meeting place.

## How does it work?

[Find players looking for a team](https://www.teamtavern.net/games/dota2/players), contact them directly on Steam or Discord and team up in-game. Create your own player profile by writing about yourself, your in-game achievements and ambitions and let teams and players find you.

[Find teams looking for players](https://www.teamtavern.net/games/dota2/teams), contact them directly on Steam or Discord and team up in-game. Create your own team profile by writing about your team and what you're looking for in new team members and let players find you.

## Why did you make this?

Poor match quality is a common complaint across esports titles. Whether it's smurfing, abandoning, cheating or toxic behavior, you end up wishing the match ends as soon as possible. No matter how good the matchmaking system is, these problems always show up. TeamTavern helps you find teammates you'll be comfortable playing with and have better quality matches with.

## How is it different from forums or Discord servers?

TeamTavern features rich profiles and advanced filtering of both players and teams enabling you to find the right group to play with.

However, I think this may be too powerful when combined with the fact that you see the current aegis timer on the hero whether they are in vision or not.

One solution would be to just freeze the time when they are not in vision. I haven't checked but this might be what it does with other stackable items such as wards? (Or does it show you the number updating in real time?)

DotA2,necrophos buff migth be more substancial than it appears,"so necrophos just got his Q mana reduced by 30 while it does not seems like a lot lets do some calculations

every last hit gives you 7 mana per second for 8 seconds so in total you get 56 mana per last hit

last patch you needed 190 mana so you need to last hit 190/56= 3.39 creeps to get you mana back

now you only need 160/56= 2.85 last hits to get you mana back .

that is 0.54 less last hits needed to sustain your mana , over the course of a game it adds up a lot

and the better part is that the level 10 talent increased the mana gain from 56 to 70 per last hit

so with old patch manacost and level 10 talent you need 190/70= 2.7 last hits

and with new patch and mana cost you need 160/56 = 2.85 last hits , so we allmost got the level 10 talent for free in terms of mana sustain as long as we just use Q

But, After many years of playing this game I realize that Yuumi is the manifestation of death itself. Her rework this time made me realize that her design will never be fixed and that she is a cancer that Riot planted in the game and that the idea of balancing her will never happen because she's a champion for the people who don't want to learn the game . Where they're just backseat gaming. Even a bad ADC is rewarded because of this filthy feline. This atrociously designed abomination made me realize that the other champions in the game are not so bad at all but she is hell reincarnate.

Morgana was mentioned in Sylas lore and Sylas seems to be the only thing that keeps Morgana relevant lorewise. Morgana is also going to appear in Sylas new game: The Mageseeker

leagueoflegends,"How is toplane one of the most popular lanes, while being also the most punishing one?","Just think about it, how your lane plays out is already decided in champ select, whoever gets last pick counterpicks the enemy toplaner and dominates the lanestate until mid game.

If you fuck up wave management just once while being counterpicked, youre basicly 2 levels behind unless your jungler decides to bail you out by breaking the freeze. The other way which doesnt involve the jungler, is intentionally dying to break freeze.

The other thing is that you dont have any impact on the game unless you are ultra fed. You can be 3/0/0 or 1/6/0, it wont matter at all, because usually the game is decided by either the jungler or your botlaners and dont you even dare leave your lane to try to help them out, or you lose all your towers on toplane.",Azazeleus,09/03/23 10:52:15 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11mgm0d/how_is_toplane_one_of_the_most_popular_lanes/

I don't know if it's something that's intended, I don't think so, but it's kinda busted in my opinion, if you get some kills early you could get an early Muramana and easily win lane with some adcs.",Bellamy1710,10/03/23 05:35:11 PM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11nkhuw/yuumi_stacking_tear_for_another_champion/

leagueoflegends,The problem with riots champion/item design.," I wish riot would respect the boundries they have themselves put in place regarding roles and archetypes in the game. Tanks are supposed to trade damage for durability and cc, lets make K'sante who also deals more true damage than a fighter. Enchanters are supposed to be high priority targets who are mechanically easy but gated mostly by careful positioning, lets make yuumi who completely ignores positioning. Juggernauts are meant to be giga strong in melee but have limited mobility? Lets add stridebreaker into the game with a dash completely removing their one weakness. Adc's and skirmishers meant to be high damage but squishy? lets add shieldbow cause why the fuck not. 

 And yes most of these things get addressed via nerfs eventually but my point is that its so blatantly obvious these things dont work before they are even implemented they shouldnt have to literally break the game for several patches until they get nerfed to the point of being unplayable because there is no way for them to exist in a balanced state. Wish riot would just respect the limitations of roles in the game and design within them instead of trying to have every new champ do everything and end up with more balance nightmares.",Popelip0,08/03/23 09:36:29 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11libx1/the_problem_with_riots_championitem_design/
leagueoflegends,Toplaners should complain less about counters/pick order and learn some safe first pick champs,"I'm not denying that top is the lane with the most hard counters and that the last pick gets the luxury to counter his opponent, but most toplaners seem to not even try to pick something safe when first picking, instead they pick their favourite or whatever they feel like playing and then complain when getting counterpicked.

Examples of safe first picks are champs that have/can

* disengage

* farm from range

* flexible build options

* brings utility

Malphite, Shen and Tahm are good examples.",baltoboulbobbi,12/03/23 07:45:03 PM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11pcm69/toplaners_should_complain_less_about_counterspick/

In the game I saw 2,635, but upon slowing to .25, technically the enemy Ekko 3rd proc E'd the baron from 1,998 (not shown) to steal without smite (Mid Ekko). Still, this is over 800 more than smite. This feels wrong to me. Especially when our team is doing the right thing with the enemy Jungler dead. Idk. I just feel like to not even give our Jungler a chance this feels absolutely preposterous. Funny this happened on the day they buffed Jinx Rocket from 800 to 1,200. It begs the question, I feel like every skill in the game should be capped at 1,200. You should not be able to point and click with Ekko E to do 2k on a baron in one button. I dont think any one button should do more than 1,200 if that's what smite is. Thats not right.

leagueoflegends,A Vietnamese Teemo main just broke the 20 million mastery point barrier on one champion,"It's amazing to see this. As someone with not even 10% of this person's mastery on Teemo, it's just insane how many games they've probably played. It's probably in the thousands if not tens of thousands.

If you're wondering about the 2nd player, it's GeT CoN TRollED with a little less than a million mastery gap in between them. Mindblowing.

leagueoflegends,A case for addressing Patch 6.9 QSS effect and champ effects,"For those not in the know, patch 6.9 addressed the use of QSS to remove combat debuffs (fiora ult, zed ult, trundle ult etc..) which while debatably healthy also makes it impossible to do the ryu vs faker play ever again.  


However we still have issues here, champions like (but not limited to)  Mordekaiser and warwick fit with the statement they made  


Patch 6.9 statement "" The QSS and Mercurial Scimitar active has two uses: cleansing crowd control (Amumu ult) and purging combat debuffs (Zed ult). These cases differ in that crowd control is setup, while combat debuffs are the payoffs to such setup. When you cleanse CC, the enemy needs to lock you down again to aggress on you, but that tends to bpretty reasonable ask. By contrast, cleansing a combat debuff wipes the applicator's primary means of fighting you. So, those champs are pressured to snowball before their effects become meaningless, while their opponents are forced into buying QSS even if it's incredibly inefficient to do so. This leads to destructive effects on game balance which we've left unanswered for too long. With the understanding that there may be outliers we need to address, we're unshackling combat debuff champs from their quicksilver collars.

ACTIVE EFFECT : The actives of Quicksilver Sash and Mercurial Scimitar now only remove crowd control debuffs ""

&amp;#x200B;

Mordekaiser ult locks you in an arena debatable if it should be considered crowd control and steals your stats, meanwhile if you QSS the ult, you not only leave the arena, you also regain your stats and he loses them, compare this to trundle who still keeps leeching hp and resistances. My argument here is the stats stolen shouldn't be lost, even if cleansing from the realm, and probably should still apply even if going into the realm is negated by some means (olaf ult) as that fits in line with ""cleansing a combat debuff wipes the applicator's primary means of fighting you""  


Warwick is an odd situation because he suppresses you and becomes inoperable himself, locking himself into a lengthier and less useful renekton stun whos only upside is the potential huge leap, and the downside is unlike renekton you can reduce the total damage done by qssing it. Thus leaving warwick next to you, but completely losing out on the damage he should be doing, and probably healing to go with it. When compared with other suppresses, malz still ticks his space barf damage on you, although you can walk outside the void puddle to lessen the damage, and while skarner does lose the ability's to pull you around, the upfront damage, for as little as it is is still done. 

Warwick's damage isn't front loaded and thus completely loses out on both CC and damage, on top of suffering the downside of while doing it still remaining suppressed himself for the duration of his ult. This fits him more in line with the ""payoff to such setup"" despite his ult being a crowd control. Morgana Q, LB chain, Sej Ult, tons of CC in the game even if ignored by oranges, kitty roars, or an overly mad viking still end up doing damage, but warwicks just.... doesnt.  
Im not saying he needs to still be able to suppress the REEE viking or have oranges ignore it, my argument is the attacks should still go through but lose the suppression.

There are probably other abilities that interact like these that I am not currently thinking of and they should be looked at too.

TL;DR Some damage/combat debuffs are linked to CC and are punished for being linked to CC. The damage/combat debuffs shouldn't be cleansable by QSS like effects and they need to be adjusted.",BladedFlame,12/03/23 02:55:12 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11orw1d/a_case_for_addressing_patch_69_qss_effect_and/

leagueoflegends,"A few months into 2023, how do you feel about 2022’s champion releases?","So now that it’s March and the initial feeling of “Zeri can run around and mach 10 with 3k health and normal ADC damage” or “K’Sante keeps oneshotting me” have faded, how do you feel about last years champion releases? Are they 200 years extremely frustrating to play against or fairly reasonable and fun? I’ve included my own (biased) takes below but am mostly curious what the community thinks.

————-

Zeri: Zeri has definitely proven to be a major challenge for Riot’s balance team, but I feel like she has settled into a fairly healthy niche for solo queue, even if her numbers are kept weak. Her core mechanic of skillshot autos makes her feel fair to fight and I think Riot has found a healthy spot for her power distribution between abilities. It’s probably also worth noting that she and K’Sante are the only releases that haven’t been consistently strong in the meta since their release.

Renata: Renata was my personal favorite release from last year due mostly to her theming and ultimate. I think her power budget is generally well allocated and she is overall healthy for the game. My one complaint is that even though her revive hasn’t proven to be OP, I still would have preferred if they had given her something else on her W, but that’s just my personal preference coming from other enchanters.

Bel’Veth: Bel’Veth is definitely my least favorite of last year’s releases, largely due to my initial expectations of a “void jungler that carefully plans things” as being a mage or highly technical assassin and because of how much of her power is in her E. Aside from my personal letdown that we weren’t getting a true mage jungler like I had hoped for, she feels very stat-checky for a recent champion to me. The only real change that I would want to see in her kit would be a change to her E to make it scaling, CC interruptible, or significantly reduce her damage. Whenever I play as or against her, it normally feels like E up = she wins and E down = she’s going to have to use her dashes to book it out of the fight.

Nilah: I feel like I never see her get played, even though she’s generally a strong pick with reliable scaling. My theory is that this is because she fills a niche very few people were asking for. Most ADC players don’t want to play a skirmisher, but she also isn’t a lane bully who can stomp you early without knowing a lot about botlane already. I was initially skeptical of her ally dodge ability, but it’s short duration and long cooldown seem to keep it in check. She should be fine as long as she continues to be a niche pick balanced around being played by her mains.

K’Sante: I have very little to say about this man overall. I don’t play much toplane and he hasn’t been very popular since his nerfs over the winter. When I do see him in my games, he is pretty unproblematic. To me he feels like Ornn if he prioritized skirmishes over teamfights. A strong release that finally gave us a new toplane tank after years.

Overall I feel that last years releases were much stronger than 2021’s, with clearer weaknesses and counterplay while keeping the dynamic, fast-paced feeling Riot has been pushing for since the late 2010s.

leagueoflegends,"It's a big shame we will never have a story like 2018 Griffin, 2016 G2 or 2013 Cloud9 ever again in League of Legends esports. This is one of the biggest downsides of franchising in my opinion.","I know most teams that promoted into the main leagues sucked. I am not contesting that. But every once in a while, you had amazing teams coming up.

2013 C9 is the big example of a team who just promoted and stomped everyone. This was early in the ecosystem however so we likely wouldn't see that today.

But there are also later examples. 2016 G2 winning their first split in a huge upset fashion - and then replacing 3 players lmao.

2018 Griffin is my personal favorite example and one of my favorite teams of all time.

These guys just went into LCK and destroyed everyone. They were very hard done by in the weird LCK playoff format where you slotted straight to finals if you finished #1 in regular season. They didn't really get to have any BO5 training or experience which imo really hurt them so they choked a lot of finals and never really realized their potential.

But that's another point. Damwon 2019 is a similar example and they did manage to realize their potential.

The main point is this:

It was super exciting to see a new crop of players coming up and challenging the established teams.

New org name, new players. It was so cool. It doesn't hit the same when it's just the same org with some new players and some old.

leagueoflegends,Lets talk about tanks.,"This is not meant as a rant post per say, just genuinely curious about this.
I recently hit Master on ADC, and the one thing I always wondered during my journey was: 'Why do tanks, do more damage then me and the enemy adc endgame?' 
Sure, in toplane you may fight a lot which will obviously increase their total damage output, however I have an example here which I think is pretty stupid
Take DR.Mundo, he was building full tank. Heartsteel, Sunfire, Thornmail etc. Only bruiser item he had was Titanic Hydra which gives 30 ad (If im not mistaken, could be more or less.) I on the other hand was playing MissFortune, full AD build. This guy literally had 609 AD, whilst I had 539. How is this okay? He runs up to anyone, procs heartsteel and does like 50% of your hp. Afterwards he just cant die. Dont get me wrong, im fine with assasins jumping in and oneshotting you - Usually theyre dead too considering they are in the middle of the team now. With tanks its just not the case. They one tap your backline and walk out because they have 600+ AD and 6k health.
Like I said, I dont mean to rant as im obviously satisfied with my achievement so far. But I am curious if any of you could explain to me in what way tanks are balanced? 
Im talking about champs like Sion, Mundo, Ornn.

leagueoflegends,"As an AD Bruiser top main, if Riot nerfs Prowler’s Claw because we keep building it; I’ll just start building Galeforce.","The only reason any bruiser builds Prowler’s Claw is because Stridebreaker is completely worthless as an item. The entire point is to help you catch targets who are extremely mobile, but in this Ashe Support, Galeforce infested meta, Stridbreaker does nothing because you can never get close enough to use the active. 

Prowler’s Claw is built over Stridebreaker almost exclusively when the enemy top laner is a range/mage (excluding gangplank who’s pseudo range). In these matchups, since the top is squishy; this probably means their whole team is relatively squishy so we can afford to take a worthless stat like Lethality because the enemy team comp is garbage. The dash given by Prowler’s makes up for the stat loss since stats don’t matter if you can’t touch your enemies. 

If Prowler’s Claw gets nerf’d and Stridebreaker does not get buffed to compensate for this, I will simply start building Galeforce into Navori Quickblades; because as I mentioned earlier. Stats mean nothing if I can’t touch my enemies. And while Galeforce dash isn’t as good as Prowler’s Dash, it’s better than  Stridebreaker, which only helps you AFTER you have reached your target. Then you’ll have Sett, Darius, Renekton running around with Galeforce, navori instead of Prowler’s Bork (Hell renekton will prob still build bork). 

Don’t nerf Prowler’s Claw, fix the actual problem. Stridebreaker is shit, and doesn’t actually do what it’s intended. This prowler’s nerf is just a bad band-aid that’s also nerfing all the assassins who are already not having a fun time dealing with Jak’Sho.

leagueoflegends,A newcomer's from Dota first experience,"I've been playing Dota for quite some time now (8k hours), but recently [Gaben showed yet again how little he cares about the game](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/11kh9ru/the_dead_reckoning_update_hola_muerta_gameplay/), so I decided to switch to LoL for a month or two.

From the get-go, I struggled with the client's settings and was trying for like half an hour to make the client fullscreen, only to fail miserably. Seriously, the whole thing took me more than 2 hours to set up (mostly thanks to camera unlock not working properly in tutorial, which led me to think my game was bugged). 

After playing my first two games with Miss Fortune (ofc with bots), I started my first MM game, where I got my ass handed to me by Evelynn, so now I am a sweaty Eve main :p. And here is what my multiplayer experience was like after 2 days of playing:

\-The game itself seems really fast-paced, and the fights that take place usually end in 10 seconds or so, since everyone either oneshots an enemy, or dies to a oneshot;

\-I still haven't figured out (and didn't bother to look up on wiki) what buffs most of the bosses provide. I noticed that the crab thingy on top fights for your side, and the dragons empower your heroes in some ways (and apparently create warpers on your base or smth), but overall it is not clear what bosses to kill and when, since I don't know my limits yet and if it is worth it;

\-Overall it's quite refreshing to experince a lot of new mechanics and peculiarities, for example the almost complete abscence of stuns (in dota almost every hero can stun for upwards of 2 sec, and the fights last at least for 20 seconds or even longer), shared skills like flash and smite, bushes and so on;

P.S: Dota overwhelms you with mechanics the first time you play, and it really really takes a lot of time to get used to(denies, couriers, smoke ganks, stacks, aggro and the list goes on and on), whereas here it is manageable, and you can enjoy the gameplay more and sooner;

\-The game is very tricky when it comes to escaping ganks, so if you get jumped by 2 or more heroes it is almost certainly a death, at least from my experince. Imo it's best to just try to avoid ganks by playing the map correctly.

There were a few problems I encountered other than the settings:

1)The most annoying thing is the queue and load time, leavers and match restarts after someone quits during the draft. It often took me way over than 30 minutes to start a proper game (which would then usually end in 15 minutes, but more about that later). It seems to me that, whatever a penalty there is, it is not quite strict enough, and the loading screens lasting over close to 2 minutes is just insane imo.

2)The 'surrender' guys. There were a lot of players who fed their lanes and then spammed surrender for the rest of the game, which killed all the remaining morale and will to play on.  If their attempts to surrender ended up in vain, they would often just leave, resulting in the aforementioned  15-20 min ffs.

3) It seems almost impossible to play from behind, there is no (as I understand) comeback mechanics other than a small added bounty for kill streaks. And it's hard to utilize even that, beacause enemies just stack as five and end the game.

4) Voice chat?

In conclusion, LoL is a lot less compelx compared to Dota and although I'd like to have couriers, fast buy and denies, I am still not sure if this relative simplicity is a bad thing, it just takes time to get used to I guess. The game seems to be alive and one can really enjoy it fully, even despite the weird MM stuff. 

I hope when I get to ranked (I'm level 17 now) the problems with MM will go way at least partially.",Used_Arm_3873,12/03/23 01:53:56 PM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11p6tf0/a_newcomers_from_dota_first_experience/

leagueoflegends,This season is too easy. Straight up.,"It's so easy to get diamond now (top 3% of players are diamond while last season it was 2%, with older seasons being top 1%). Same of plat, gold, etc. There are more masters players than ever -- top 0.8%, which is astronomically high compared to previous seasons. This is just Riot's attempt to give people the illusion of climbing and getting better while their percentile placements are the same. A lot of this rank inflation is attributed to the promo nerfs and increased LP gains. This allows people to go on a single winstreak and climb two divisions. Couple this with the difficulty of actually demoting from an IV division and this causes a large skew of ranks where people technically don't belong in terms of MMR. It's just disingenuous IMO",SurrealJay,10/03/23 04:07:35 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11n29bz/this_season_is_too_easy_straight_up/
leagueoflegends,An Enchanter for APCs (custom champ concept),"# Bathory, the Blood-bending Priestess 

Bathory is an Enchanter, but she's meant to synergize better with AP Carries like Swain, Seraphine, Ziggs etc. (otherwise you can play her with an Ezreal) due to her kit that aims to increase abilities' damage, grant ability haste and reduce magic resistance.

# Abilities

**P -** **Innate:** Affecting an allied champion with a spell, enhances their next ability cast within 6s to deal an additional 30 - 200 *(based on ally lv.)* (+15% of target ally's **bonus** AD or AP adaptively) magic damage to the first enemy champion hit and refund 50 / 75 / 100% *(lv. 1 / 7 / 13)* of its Mana / Energy Cost *(only if at least one champion is hit).*  
This ability can’t target the same allied champion more than once every few seconds.  
*Spells that empower attacks apply this passive's effect on-attack.*

*Per-target Cooldown:* 18 - 6 *(lv. 1 - 13)*

**Q -** **Active:** Bathory launches a sphere in a line in the target direction that explodes upon hitting an enemy or reaching ithe maximum distance, dealing 90 / 120 / 150 / 180 / 210 (+45% AP) magic damage and leaving a trail in the target direction starting from the impact point.

*Cooldown:* 14 *Cost:* 70

**W -** **Active:** Bathory grants a target allied champion or herself 20 / 22.5 / 25 / 27.5 / 30% (+3% per 100 AP) **bonus** movement speed and 8 / 11 / 14 / 17 / 20 (+4% AP) Ability Haste for 4s.

**Enemy:** Bathory deals 80 / 105 / 130 / 155 / 180 (+40% AP) magic damage and heals herself for 50% of the pre-mitigation damage dealt.

*Static Cooldown between casts:* 1 *Per charge Cooldown:* 16 / 15 / 14 / 13 / 12

*Cost:* 40 / 45 / 50 / 55 / 60

After 1.5s, the circle erupts to root enemies that are still in it for 1 / 1.5 / 2s and reapply the Magic res. reduction for 4s.  
Additionally, allied champions that were inside the circle at the moment of the eruption are empowered by Innate ability.

*Cooldown:* 110 / 90 / 70 *Cost:* 100

# Lore

No one knows too much about Bathory's past, except that she once was a member of the Crimson Circle led by Vladimir.  
Despite her great power, she was nothing alike the other members of the Circle.  
Her kind soul was willing to use the blood magic not too harm others, but to help them, so she ended up to left the Circle.  
Now Bathory travels across Noxian territories, helping those in need and escaping the Crimson Circle which wants her back to use her powers as a weapon.",Grondaia_Marcia,11/03/23 09:37:44 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11o7aex/an_enchanter_for_apcs_custom_champ_concept/

leagueoflegends,My take on how to fix Asol.,"As far as I know, W reset is one of the most frustrating parts of his kit to play against. This is why I would change:

- W reset on takedowns REMOVED.

- W base flight distance buffed (scaling lowered a bit to compensate, ends up similar or a bit below live). Possible CD buffs to considerate.

- While flying, kill participation against champions or epic monsters allows you to recast W to restart the flight in another direction.

- When you successfully get to recast E (and before doing so), the flight distance extends a flat amount (the landing point is relocated ~2 seconds of flight time away). This procs once per flight.
The extra distance would act as a 'redirect window'. 


This potentially fixes two things:

1. Adds skill expression. Now you HAVE to kill/ damage champions (or Baron/Drake) while flying if you want a proper reset, and have to react to the map after a takedown to extend your flight. 

2. Nerfs his multikill potential during late game/ his map influence. At the moment its too easy to chain kill after kill once the main threat dies. Its combo (Q during W) has not enough counterplay to be so easy to access again and again.

The idea behind these changes would be introducing a more conditional 'high satisfaction moment'  that fits the flying space dragon power fantasy. It would add a high moment to a somewhat linear kit.

You could even add a cool turning animation with particle effects around him to convey the idea that he is using his W recast to extend his flight, potentially in another direction.

What do you think about it? Do you think I target the problem with his kit that makes him so banned?",Boneyking_,13/03/23 08:02:51 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11pu9x8/my_take_on_how_to_fix_asol/

leagueoflegends,Having Trouble Winning games on ADC,"Currently in Gold 4-- i play pretty casually and have for a long time-- have hit plat before but couldn't tell you which season it was. My BF and I play bot lane together as I used to main ADC back when i did hit plat, though nowadays I typically like to play mid more. We usually do quite well (though, like everyone, we have our bad games) and typically win the 2v2 and possibly even snowball. 

&amp;#x200B;

The reason we struggle to win games though is that as soon as we start to gain some steam in our lane we constantly get 4/5 manned bottom. Like I'm talking going from 4-0 to 4-4 in the span of 6-7 minutes. And I'm not trying to over exaggerate but it actually happens ALOT. You would think that eventually it would balance out and you would get teams that prio bot in the same way but it just doesn't happen. I'm wondering if its maybe because of our relatively aggressive laning style that draws attention to us? BF mains Sona and i typically pick an ADC based on team comps, but we consistently freeze the enemy bot lane off waves and just generally create a lot of pressure.

&amp;#x200B;

Is there some sort of secret that we could do to try and mitigate getting absolutely rolled by ""team diff"" in the bot lane? It feels so helpless doing so well and just getting flattened by dives/ganks with no counter pressure anywhere else on the map. Like do i need to be begging to babysat by the jungler and just hope they listen? Is there a pick that I can play that can just outplay the 4 man dives if I notice it happening consistently (which I do). 

I'm not trying to just place the blame on my team-- but rather trying to figure out if there's something we can do to improve our chances so that I can carry when I'm ahead... or do we just literally chalk it up to team diff and hope that next game we get the team that prio's bot?",mokanshu,08/03/23 01:45:24 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11l5wsc/having_trouble_winning_games_on_adc/

Dont know if its exclusive to Diamond+games but from my experience the best and more popular supports are :

Rakan who is a proactive playmaker. 
Thresh who is a proactive playmaker. 

Karma who is the only enchanter that cant do her job by sitting behind the adc and pressing one button. Her gameplay is to harass you, shove the wave and roam. Her agressive playstyle allows for much greater skill expression. You can tell when a Karma player is good. 

Annie who as a support she can be extremly flexible and adapt to multiple playstyles. Much more interesting that her usual role of fishing for oneshots all game in mid. You can be very creative with Tibbers and use him for example to scout for vision, tank skillshots/turret aggro etc.

Braum who is the only tank with a not binary gameplay, and of course Brand who has just bs damage, but he feels good to play.

leagueoflegends,Why tank and building HP has terrible satisfaction right now.,"BOTRK was buffed to 12% current HP,  
Then durability patch dropped meaning this item gains more value  
Then tanks lost damage in return for durability (radiant, jak'sho, heartsteel) which gives even more agency to BOTRK.  
Then the BOTRK nerf did not affect tanks at all.   
Then BC was buffed and ADC items were buffed (including LDR)  


With BC/ BOTRK being must-rush for every champion that can use them, any HP you build just get shredded by BOTRK, and any resistances you build lose 30 - 50% value from BC + LDR combo. This means that even champions bad vs tanks shred through tanks now, and not to mention adcs being overpowered right now just makes this problem worse where tanks can't be tanky.

This is why tank satisfaction is so terrible.",HEAD_KGB_AGENT,11/03/23 10:29:14 PM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11oljqs/why_tank_and_building_hp_has_terrible/

leagueoflegends,Need advice on how to prepare myself for solo play.,"I've been playing League since late 2012 (newest champion at the time I believe was Kha'Zix) and at that time I had a really bad family computer (and my current server didn't exist yet so I had 250 ping playing on NA) I tried playing some pvp games and got beat so bad in them that my own team told me to do very bad thing that I probably cannot mention here, that experience has haunted my League gameplay for years I only have that dread when playing League, no other multiplayer game, after a few years I got a laptop that still wasn't great and after a while it started having a really poor connection to the internet so I played bot games to get my league fix until I got a better computer.

I was still able to play with friends in ARAMs because they didn't care about how I did or who I played but now that I have had a new computer for a few months now I still can't find the courage to queue into anything other than ARAMs with friends or bot games when solo because I don't want to let my teammates down with my poor gameplay.

Sorry if this was really poorly written, I just really want to try getting back into League PvP (whether it be Summoner's Rift or Howling Abyss) after so many years of bot games and putting my friends through countless 4.5v5s.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: I think one of the things that puts a lot of that dread I talked about earlier in me is that a lot of players use third party apps like Poroffessor to get info on the people in the game and I know that someone could use these apps and see that I don't play often and decide the best course of action is to camp me or target me because I'm a very obvious weak link, not saying you shouldn't use those apps it's just a fear I have.",ZoroOvDaArk,09/03/23 03:48:30 PM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11mmbc9/need_advice_on_how_to_prepare_myself_for_solo_play/

It’s been about 12 games and I’ve lost 10 out of the 12. Every single game I get at least 1 troll and then at least one person sometimes the same person as the troll will have 5-8 deaths before laning phase is even over. I still usually beat my laner however the enemy team has so far never gotten an inter/someone who dies a lot once and all of my teammates seem to be extremely toxic (more then the usual) and most will give up at the slight inconvenience and start intentionally trying to lose the game. I get games like this all the time that are unloseable but I get enough games that are neutral or winning on my side for it not to matter.

leagueoflegends,It's so disrespectful that Riot doesn't value our time.,"If the server needs to go down for maintenance shouldn't there be a warning for any game that starts within 30-60 minutes of that downtime? It's terrible you can spend 25 minutes in a game and get disconnected because the server is offline suddenly. Basically any other game I've ever played would have given everyone who was in a game some ""loot"" for the inconvenience. It's terrible customer service that we don't wake up to a free skin or some essence or RP or something.   


When you join this game there's an opportunity cost and each game is a commitment to 4 other people that you're not going to be a jerk and waste their time by quitting. By the same token the players make this game possible and treating our time like garbage is just awful. It's zero effort to add a popup to the code that gives a warning of planned maintenance. Lots of games would still give a little blue essence just for the downtime but at least if we had a heads up fair is fair and I wouldn't be bitter about wasting half a games worth of time twice in the last 4 days.  


If it's unplanned maintenance and you're just pretending it's planned then you definitely need to dish out some RP/Essence/Chest etc..",boknows65,08/03/23 07:23:54 PM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11ltulj/its_so_disrespectful_that_riot_doesnt_value_our/

leagueoflegends,"New Champions should be the main Theme of Events, not just a small Part of them","Post ended up being quite long, TL;DR at the Bottom. Sorry for bad English or Typos.

The Way Riot currently handles their new Champion Releases is they will make a Champion, maybe tease them in the Game with a small Reference or a Voice Line, maybe release some Story or Video about them and then release the Champion along side an Event, complete with an Event Pass, Rewards, Skins, a Prestige Skin and so on. This usually means that the Champion sometimes is overshadowed by the Event, no longer being the main big Thing to be released in the Patch.

Riot should instead make make new Champions the main Theme of these Events, and build the Event around the Champion.

Dota's latest Hero, Muerta, a Gunslinger themed around the Santa Muerte, recently released into the Game. And to my Surprise, she got released along side a whole interactive Menu where you can click around to read her story from a Cowboy Style Newspaper (similar to Milio's Letters) aswell as a whole Minigame and Event where each Player gets an enemy Target to kill every Match, and the more you kill that Target the more Points you get to unlock themed Chests.

The coolest Part is that these Chests contain Sets (Skins) related to Muerta, mostly inspired by her Design, with similar Outfits and Tatoos that you'd find in a Day of the Dead Celebration.

Imagine if instead of getting a bunch of random Fairy themed Skins we got Ixtal themed Skins for some of the Champions he meets in his Letters like Nidalee, Neeko (and I also belive Zyra and Malphite were speculated?) If they really wanted, they could have released a Master of the Elements Karma or Ezreal Skin to check those ""Legendary Skin"" and ""Ezreal Skin"" Boxes. 

Like that, not only could Milio completely detach from the Event and get a unique and actually good first Skin (this is a biased Opinion as I dislike the Skin he's releasing with) but he could become the central Part of the Event. The Event would be about *him* instead of random Fairy Skins and Fairy Universe Lore that nobody cares about.

TL;DR: Riot should design Events around their newest Champions and make Skins themed around that Champion's Theme or Region in order for the Champion to stand out more and become the Core of the Patch/ Event and not get overshadowed by random Skins.",Unknown_Warrior43,12/03/23 02:55:56 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11orwr7/new_champions_should_be_the_main_theme_of_events/

leagueoflegends,new yuumi passive is punishing instead of rewarding,"Yuumis new passive gives you a ""best friend"" so you get bonus stuff when staying on him and he gets an on-hit heal that's disgusting.

I have several problems with this:

1. Passivity: It encourages you to stay on your adc even more than the old one. Your heal can proc only every 15s on avg, which is higher than q cd. So there's no need to aa enemies anymore (except for dmg, but you're a squishy ball of 0 dmg) en contraire: You take the on-hit healing from your adc if you do it. So not being on your adc is basically grieving.
2. Visibility: Nowhere is shown, how many stacks there are. The passive tells me who is the most loved, but literally nothing indicades how much. Not on me, not on my allies, nowhere. There's no scaling on it, but if you wanna switch, you have no clue how long it takes to get a new best friend.
3. Dependency: This is the worst part. Since you are now best staying in your adc for the first 10 minutes straight, you have a lot of stacks of your passive on them. Or just some, or a fckton, man nowhere can i even see the stack value. Now imagine your adc is not the most useful player and you have a fed top/jgl like olaf where you also can give your full potential. You now have to spend years to get the same amount of stacks as you did on your adc. In this process you lose about 30% (?) of your power. A top is not happy with you sharing their XP just because you need passive stacks. So you either stay useless on adc, or you are useless or even damaging to your team trying to get useful later on.
4. Worth: Yuumi has to stay on the best friend to get the potential of any other enchanter. No other enchanter has this problem. You try keeping your adc alive, but in 1/4 cases you can't keep your **carry** alive. You are just not good enough without this passive.

All in all this feels like a ""don't lane or you lose any purpose"" situation. This is 100% only about the passive and not about any other numbers. She might still be broken, but losing with her feels even worse than adc against 5 fed assassins.

Edit:
Maybe that point went under the stone, but new passive encourages you to do the very passive q-only never leaving playstyle people complained about. But now yuumi has no other choice but to do so. Only thing that changed is she is bound to her adc instead of top/ mid, so you have even less decisions to impact the game.",vide2,12/03/23 11:14:35 PM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11pgw2f/new_yuumi_passive_is_punishing_instead_of/

leagueoflegends,Wonder When They Will Figure Out That Indirectly Nerfing Issues Isnt How You Fix Them,"The main issue I am referring to is bruisers dealing way more damage than they need to be doing, and being ablke to stay in fights and out heal people. The solution supposedly this patch was to nerf the healing on grasp,  but like no the issue is that the only bruiser item that is okay is divine because it is just an assassin item with some healing on it. other than that every other bruiser choses to take an assassin item because it is just outright better being able to just get lethality, or straight % armor penetration because 90% of bruisers are ad and with their already overloaded damage you can basically just dish out near true damage. 

You want to fix issues like this then just make the items specifically class based, Tanks can build tank items, bruisers can build bruiser items, etc. do what overwatch did in a way where they made it 1 tank 2 dps 2 healer but in the form of items where you must build based on your champs role. This will keep bruisers from dealing too much damage, or supports from obliterating you with too much ap. Yes you would have to make more support items for like senna etc. but like its getting quite boring for example seeing gangplank get nerfed this patch but in reality the nerf not going to effect him 100 to 0 people in less than a second because his passive cannot apply onto barrels and the recharge rate does not effect the damage they apply, if you nerfed the crit damage on them or the armor negation they do then it would lower his damage output and be a real nerf. 

But an example of a good nerf was triumph although it took you almost 2 years to see that healing for 10% of your missing hp after a takedown was a bit too much. 

I honestly wouldn't mind if instead of 2 week patches you took much longer to release patches but they were more thought out kinda how dota 2 does it where when they release a big patch its actually that big, and it can be argued that patches in league are big but they are not there may be 1-2 big changes to champions but they throw in little things to inflate it like the yorick e damage nerf, when I hear whos dominating 13.4 yorick is not up there. Or like tryndameres 3 hp growth buff and .3 ad growth, whats the point, this doesn't add anything all that is gonna happen is more split pushing tryndameres but really he already does a stupid amount of damage and has a free get out of death card why are we making someone that gets to be invincible for a few seconds do more damage?",Megamonster4332,11/03/23 06:46:32 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11o3dao/wonder_when_they_will_figure_out_that_indirectly/

Back in the old days it kinda hinted at how much gold the enemy had but nowadays... there's so many different ways to get gold and barely any of them are trackable anymore. (Bounties, Shutdowns, Runes, Inate abilities,...)  
   
On other hand it just causes toxicity. People see 7v3 on the top of their screen and just start to spam ff and grief while the gold difference isn't even 1k.

leagueoflegends,An updated version of leagues tribunal system could really do a lot to improve toxicity. Here are some ways that it could legitimately and successfully be implemented:," 

The League of Legends tribunal system was a player-run initiative where players could review reported cases of toxic behavior and vote on a verdict. However, the system was ultimately discontinued due to various issues, including:

1. Inconsistency in verdicts: The decisions made by the tribunal were often inconsistent and unpredictable, leading to frustration among players.
2. Slow response time: The tribunal system relied on a large pool of volunteers to review cases, which could result in long wait times for cases to be reviewed and decisions to be made.
3. Lack of transparency: The tribunal system did not provide enough information to players about the decision-making process or the reasoning behind verdicts, leading to confusion and mistrust.
4. Difficulty in enforcement: Even when a player was found guilty by the tribunal, there was often no effective way to enforce the verdict or prevent the player from continuing their toxic behavior.

To improve the tribunal system, there could have been measures taken such as improving the consistency of verdicts by providing clear guidelines and criteria for reviewers to follow. Additionally, reducing the wait time for cases to be reviewed and increasing transparency by providing more information on the decision-making process and the reasoning behind verdicts could have helped to improve player trust in the system. However, ultimately Riot Games, the developer of League of Legends, decided to discontinue the tribunal system in favor of a centralized automated system for handling toxic behavior.

it's also possible to combine the Tribunal system with current automated systems, and there are some examples of games that have done so successfully. For instance, Overwatch uses a system called ""Overwatch"" that uses both machine learning algorithms and human players to review and penalize players who violate the game's code of conduct. The system flags potential violations for human review and provides evidence in the form of replays and other data. The humans then review the evidence and vote on whether the player should be penalized or not.

Similarly, League of Legends could potentially use a combination of automated systems and human review to improve its penalty system. Automated systems could flag potential violations, and then human reviewers could assess the evidence and decide on appropriate penalties. The combination of human judgement and automated detection could lead to a more accurate and fair penalty system.",AAbattery444,10/03/23 07:16:55 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11n7aw4/an_updated_version_of_leagues_tribunal_system/

leagueoflegends,Normal draft player can't win any iron game,"I usually play normal games, and recently I decide to challenge myself a bit and play some ranked games. To my surprise, the players in Iron 2/3 are way better than those I met in normal games. Usually, they are super aggressive and would auto you like they eagerly need to get the kill. I almost always lose trade in the ranked games (sometimes I win trade in normals). Moreover, their mechanics are good (at least I don't think they should be at iron, why don't they climb up). I just don't know how to win a ranked game properly, any advice would be helpful. A reference is below:

leagueoflegends,League needs to allow you to inspect abilities of other champions in game,"Theres 150+ champions in League of Legends. I can not play, and memorize all of them and the nuance of their abilities. I do not know, for example, the exact details of say, Mordekaiser passive off the top of my head, nor should I have to. Perhaps i can get by knowing that Katarina is usually AP, and Sett is usually AD, but in certain instances, it's detrimental to my game experience to not have any idea why certain things are happening in the game and how to counter them.

Tonight I played into Olaf. I've played Olaf maybe once or twice in passing in URF or something in the past, but not enough to know the nuance of his abilities. I beat him early in lane, and I'm aware his ult blocks CC, but what I didn't know, was that his ult continues while he's meleeing, and I need to wait 2.5 seconds without him meleeing for it to stop. If I knew this, I would have done something (like buy Zhonyas, or flash away) when I'm fighting him, to prevent his ult from staying active. 

Some people might cry foul, because then you can for example, easily know how long someones cooldowns are so you can time when one of their abilities is back up, but honestly, I think it's more detrimental - especially for new players - to play into champs and have absolutely NO idea what's happening. 

All the text is in game already, just add small P Q W E R icons on the tab menu, and when you hover them it brings up the tool tip. Bam. Done. 

Perhaps there's a good argument why this shouldn't be enabled in pro - ok cool then disable it. Perhaps there's even a reason for this not to be enabled in ranked. But it should absolutely be enabled in ARAM and Draft.

The main counter is CCing whoever she is sitting on then focusing them, but what about making her hop off if hard CC is applied to the champion she is attached to. This does double down and make the champions that she struggles agains even harder counters though.

&amp;#x200B;

If that is to easy to force her off make it so that the CC needs to be applied when the champion she is attached to doesn't have a shield.

&amp;#x200B;

Is their any other way to balance her besides just nerfing numbers, it's just like removing the res from Aatox's kit, no amount of nerfing numbers removes the problem part of the kit, but once delt with it becomes easier to balance.",GodOfTheFabledAbyss,11/03/23 03:27:22 PM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11odspk/yuumi_idea/

leagueoflegends,"March Madness: A Primer on Collegiate League of Legends, Part 1: The North Conference","It’s every college basketball’s favorite time of year, which coincidentally also makes it nearly time for the Collegiate League of Legends College Championship. If you’ve never followed the collegiate scene, you’re in the right place to start. If you’ve watched previous years, you’re also in the right place to start because Riot made some major format changes this year. This primer will walk through the new format and give thoughts on some of the teams in the North Conference as we enter the final week of regular season play. 

# Conference Format

While most collegiate sports teams are affiliated with regional (or not so regional, thanks B1G) conference, most league of legends teams don’t get the same level of institutional support, so most teams are assigned to massive regional conferences, while the conference that support esports have special “partner conferences” their teams play in instead. For the past few years, these regional conferences used a 6 round Swiss pairing system to qualify for playoffs. It was simple, go 5-1 and better and make playoffs. However, this system was flawed in that it caused most teams to only have one or two series that actually mattered. The top seeds with Challenger and GM players spent four weeks smacking gold and silvers around until the last two rounds. It also meant that one off day or week could tank your entire season. This year, they changed the format by introducing the “Championship” and “Open” conferences. 

At the beginning of the year, the top 32 teams from each conference were placed in the Championship division (no team under seed 32 had ever qualified for the national championship), which removed a lot of the low-quality matchups. Then, each conference was divided into 4 groups of 8 and each team would play each other team in their group once. Instead of needing a 5-1 record, each team now just needed to place top half in their group to qualify for the 16 team playoff. 

The second piece of the season is the 14 partner conferences. These range from just 5 teams to 20 and have their own formats for regular season play, which I’ll discuss more in detail in a different post. 

# Qualification for the College Championship

Qualification for the College Championship occurs from each conference’s playoffs. Based on past performance, each regional and partner conference is allotted a number of seeds that go to their highest placing teams. This ranges from 4 seeds for the south conference to just 1 for the west. When totaled up, there are 26 directly qualifying bids to the College Championship, leaving 6 “open” bids that are assigned by selection after playoffs are complete.

# North Conference

Now that all the boring format stuff is out of the way we can get to the results. Currently, it’s the beginning of week 7 of the regular season, so we have a solid idea of how most groups will play out and a great idea of which teams might be dark horses going into playoffs. 

While the South conference has won the past two years, the North conference ranked as the number two conference and receives three championship bids. That being said, Maryville University won the title in 2019 and 2017 and is almost certainly the strongest program as a whole. Additionally, the North conference had two top 8 teams in 2022 and 3 in 2021 and had more select bids to the tourney than any other conference. Basically, the North conference has the largest selection of quality programs in the country, even if they haven’t gone all the way in the past few years. 

# Favorites

To start out this section we have **Maryville University (1 seed, Group A)**, the perennial contender from St. Louis coming in as the number 1 overall seed nationally. Maryville’s worst placement since 2017 was a 5-8th place finish in 2018. Outside that, they have two titles, a runner-up, and a 3-4th finish. They’ve won the North conference every year since its inception, are currently 6-0 in matches with zero games lost, and have LCS/NACL veteran Niles in the top lane. Their most recent tournament finish is as the best team on the amateur circuit with a 3-1 victory in the most recent proving grounds. Indisputably the best team in the conference, every team that’s in this conference is praying they avoid the 8 and 9 seeds in playoffs because an early matchup against Maryville will almost certainly end their season. 

Out of the top four seeds, the only other remaining undefeated team is **Saint Louis University (3 seed, C)**, and although they dropped one worrying game to **University of Cincinnati (14)**, this roster has nearly as much experience as Maryville. With players Airren, SkyTec, and Winnie playing for AOE Gold and CLG Faith in the NACL this year, it feels like they’re a shoe-in for one of the three seeds for this conference. However, thus far SLU has avoided playing the other top team in their conference, so tune in this weekend to see if they can take down **Illinois State (6)**.

The other notable top team in this division is **Bethany Lutheran (5 seed, D)**, currently sitting atop their group with a 6-0 record. Like SLU, they have one game loss, to **University of Iowa (13)**. Bethany has been to the College Championship the past two years, making semifinals in 2021 but being upset in the ro32 by Converse University in 2022 (who went on to make semis). Like SLU, this team has yet to face what should be their greatest challenge, **Michigan State (4)**, who they will face this weekend. 

# Dark Horses

It may seem strange to place two undefeated teams divided by only two seeds in separate categories here, but when you looked at **Northwood University’s (7 seed, B)** history, it’s clear why. The Northwood Timberwolves have never qualified for a conference playoffs, though they finished with a 4-2 record in 2021. Last year they ended 1-5, but this year they had 100% roster turnover and have been sweeping through their group to start with a 6-0 record and zero game losses. While Northwood has not seen any success in League of Legends prior to this year, they placed first in the recent Valorant North Conference and winning the Red Bull Valorant World Championship in Brazil last December, so they are a respected esports program. However, the Timberwolves have yet to play the top seed in their group, **THE Ohio State University (2)**, so tune in this weekend to see the result there. 

If you’re an observant reader, you may have noticed a lack of top team matchups up to this point in the writeup, and you may have also noticed multiple high seeds missing from the favorites categories. These next three teams are the reason why. 

First up is the **University of Iowa (13 seed, D)**, sitting at a 6-1 record with five game losses. Though they played in a playoff series as part of the Big Ten Esports Conference before it went defunct, Iowa has never played in a regional conference playoff. Iowa started the season hot, beating **Michigan State (4)** in a close 2-1 series in the first week, being the only double-digit seed across all four regional conferences to upset a single-digit seed that week, much less a top 4 seed. After their hot start, Iowa dropped individual games to both **University of Chicago (20)** and **Truman State (29)**, a worrying trend for anyone who wants to compete for a College Championship bid. However, they played their way back to the dark horse list with a 1-2 loss to **Bethany Lutheran (5)**, showing they can still compete with the best. Iowa has already completed their final series and is locked into a seed somewhere between 4 and 9 in playoffs depending on the outcome of this week’s games. 

The second major upset of this region came from **Purdue University (15 seed, B)**, who upset **THE Ohio State University (2)** in a 2-1 victory and sits at a 5-2 record with five game losses. Purdue has made the North Conference playoffs twice and the college championship once in 2021 but failed to qualify for playoffs last year. Additionally, they’ve matches lost to **Northwood (7)**, and in-state rivals **Indiana University (23)**. It’s also important to note that Ohio State was missing their starting mid for the upset. Still, an upset over a 2 seed makes this a team that no 5-8 seed wants to be matched against in the first round of playoffs. 

Our final double-digit seed upset comes from **University of Kansas (11 seed, C)**. As far as my research took me, I found Kansas hadn’t made a regional playoff, just like Northwood and Iowa. Despite losing to **University of Cincinnati (14)**, and **Saint Louis University (3)**, Kansas managed to take down powerhouse **Illinois State (6)** to cement their place in the playoffs. 

When initially writing this article, I had **THE Ohio State University (2 seed, B)** in the faltering powerhouses section, then I moved them to favorite when I realized their only match loss was with a sub mid, then I moved them to dark horses when I realized that this team has never achieved any competitive success and they look underwhelming with a loss to **Purdue (15)**. But while Ohio State has never achieved anything, the same can’t be said about their mid 5fire. For those of you who follow the amateur scene, that name should immediately make you pay attention. While 5fire hasn’t put up incredible numbers thus far in collegiate, you can’t ignore the fact that he won every amateur tournament he attended in 2021, including winning Spring Proving grounds, where his team beat teams like C9 Academy with Darshan, 100T Academy with Tenacity, Luger, Kenvi, and Poome, and GGS Academy with Chime. Of course, 

# Faltering Powerhouses

Finally we get to those missing 1-8 seeds that you’ve seen mentioned in the Dark Horses section. Despite losing matches to double-digit seeds, these teams are both historical powerhouses that are going to scare some top half seeds in the first round of playoffs. 

First is **Michigan State (4 seed, D)**. Despite losing to **Iowa (13)** early on, they’ve won 5 matches in a row, dropping individual games to **Iowa State (12)** and **UChicago (20)**. Michigan State placed top 8 at last year’s College Championship, but lost their jungler to Northwood and top and support to amateur teams. Still, two returning national quarterfinalists form a strong core and should this team beat **Bethany Lutheran (5)** this weekend, they’ll shoot right back up this list. 

Lastly, we have **Illinois State (6 seed, C)**. Like Michigan State, this is a team that has historically been very strong. They placed top 16 last year and top 8 the year before and play in more tournaments than any team on this list barring Maryville. Unfortunately, the stats for the match against Kansas aren’t available on the CLol website, so we don’t know if they were playing with any subs. Still, Illinois State has the talent and experience to make a deep run, and if they beat **Saint Louis University (3)** this weekend they’ll shoot right back up. 

That sums up the North Conference. Let me know if you prefer these writeups to be formatted by frontrunners/dark horses like I did with this post or give a group-by-group rundown in the future. I plan on posting one of these a day until this weekend then posting links to streams on Saturday, then doing a follow up before playoffs next week.",Dunglebungus,08/03/23 05:51:06 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11lckjl/march_madness_a_primer_on_collegiate_league_of/
leagueoflegends,Mage item satisfaction,"Devs have been mentioning how it hasn't been fun playing with mages since the item system rework (fact), but imo they could take a different approach than the adjusts made in 13.5

While a Riven can easily reach 150 AH even though she has 4 dashes and a stun on her basic abilities, for some reason mages can't get near that in their wildest dreams

They've recently adjusted Cosmic Drive to give some of that to mages, but what is a Veigar or a Ziggs going to do with it? Most mages can't even trigger the passive, and those who can won't put it to good use

On the other side there is Horizon Focus, that had a good passive for matches where squishy n bursty mages are encountering long fights, but it feels extremely underwhelming to use because 15 AH IT'S A JOKE

A simple solution is to balance Cosmic Drive around battlemages and AP bruisers like Demonic Embrace is (it works perfectly for them) and make Horizon Focus THE go-to AH pick for long range mages

leagueoflegends,"League is not longer enjoyable, and why ranked games are no longer good?","Firstly, i want to say that I have been playing League for multiple years since Season 5. I have enjoyed the game and have spent a lot of effort into playing the game and learning many of the champions. Though, I have to say that the game has been mostly unplayable due to the community of players that are playing the game. Currently league allows players to forfeit the game withing 15 minutes of a match. This has proved to be a negative trait to the game because it often encourages people to quit the game before it has been decided, especially when league ranked games last longer and game times are of a much longer length due to riot making changes adding plates preventing quick tower collapses. Though statistically, I am having players wanting to quit the match or going afk before that because they are instantly upset that they are 0 and 1 and will refuse to play the game or contribute. I personally never surrender games, as a game is always winnable as the enemy has the chance to make a mistake which can be capitalized on for a win. But if the game is not surrendered these players often continue to not play the game, or will sit in tower, and split the entire game. The current league system is not able to catch this type of behavior and it is far to common, which allows multiple games to be often like this. Players are far to willing to quit the game, especially in ranked games which destroys the integrity of trying to win a competitive type of match mode. I have had multiple games where I am the only person on my team fighting the entire enemy team as they try to storm our base while 2 to 3 of my teammates are sitting afk in the fountain. Riot, in my opinion, it too passive with allowing these behaviors to continue, and only does account bans which does not resolve the issue due to players just logging into a different account and continuing the behavior. I simply no longer find fun in a game that continues to set me with players that refuse to play the game. If you are to snap and say something out of line, then your account will be the one to get a chat restriction, while these players are also allowed to slip under the auto bot ban system and continue to destroy match games with their behavior. Thank you for taking the time of reading this, and feel free to respond with your personal views on the issue.",Mental-Ability-2952,11/03/23 07:03:31 PM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11ohewx/league_is_not_longer_enjoyable_and_why_ranked/

leagueoflegends,The match maker is broken or something is wrong,"There is no way I can get 10 inters in a row.  
I had people that ran it down because I took a scuttle crab to finish an item, whilst we were winning. This happens in 80% of my ranked games, how can this be possible?

leagueoflegends,Serious Thread: How is the new Yuumi?,"So I haven't played a ranked game yet in our newest patch. I'm really curious if it'll be worth using my ban on the new Yuumi. I really don't want to, because as of now, I've been using my ban on Jarvan and because there has been no mention of nerfing him, I will most likely be using my ban on him in the weeks to come. I've personally never used my ban on Yuumi, even before her rework, since I usually win the lane and I end up with a higher vision score than Yuumi.

As a non-Yuumi player, I went over to the Yuumi mains subreddit to do some intelligence gathering to see how the Yuumi mains feel and see if there are any weaknesses I can exploit and this is what I found:

a) She feels much more boring to play.

b) It will take her an eternity plus a year if she wants to change best friends, so she can't just hop on a bruiser/juggernaut anytime during the game to 2v8, which is good.

c) Her Q is easier to land now, which imo, is not good.

d) You can't really play her the same way you did as before.

e) She is low-key broken, especially with certain champs.

Now, I would like to read the thoughts of other players who have played with or against Yuumi. Do you think she's OP?",starlightdemonfriend,10/03/23 02:37:25 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11mzws1/serious_thread_how_is_the_new_yuumi/

This screen would show tips against the champion that killed you or general informations about the game, since Challenges keep track of so many think it’s would be nice for the tips to be contextual to the situation the player was in.

Additionally it could show some arrows at the bottom to also see tips against champions that gained an assist for your kill, to broaden the tips pool.",Axirez,12/03/23 10:44:22 PM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11pg5r4/concept_for_a_tip_section_that_appears_after/
leagueoflegends,The ladder currently encourages MMR to tank and discourages it to climb.,"When you lose and demote you have to lose 2 games. One to get to 0 lp and then one more. This should make you lose 40-50 lp but you only lose 25.   


What this does is artificially deflates the mmr of any player when they get demoted. But when you get promoted you only play one game and keep the lp you gain from the promotion which does not repair your mmr. The only exception is the best of series games between tiers.   


The ladder is automatically stagnating mmr seemingly by design.   


This is why its better to make a new account if you want to climb fast and your account is hard stuck. This is also why people SHOULD smurf. Because playing excessive games on your main account at plateau will force you to fall.   


The ladder is designed to make you fall the more games you play MMR wise if you get demoted.   


The only way to not have this happen is to never lose the 2 games before demoting. The first to get to 0 lp and the second which demotes you .   


If you ever lose either of those 2 games it tanks your mmr; especially if you were very close to 0 on the first game.   


You'll lose 40-50 points worth of mmr but only 25 lp on demoting. Simularly losing the game just before demoting tanks your mmr as you only lose the LP above 0 but your mmr falls further.    


Every demotion rapidly tanking your MMR; and losing any game just before demoting.   


Meanwhile then you're playing in a system which tries to predict a 50/50 chance of victory every game  


Not necessarily forcing a 50% win rate but if you're overperforming you are going to get weaker team mates to compensate.   


This is why the old ladder with best of 3 matches between every division was better. Your mmr would get inflated anytime you promoted which would make climbing MMR much easier which is the first requirement of climbing the ladder.   


Make a new account if you get hardstuck or negative point gains. Its not worth it otherwise.",Worldly_Mountain7034,09/03/23 11:24:53 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11mhbno/the_ladder_currently_encourages_mmr_to_tank_and/

leagueoflegends,Why are junglers allowed this big of an advantage in this aspect of the game?,"As we all know, junglers in lower elos are often lacking in multiple ways, but one way they aren't is the ability to flame. Don't misunderstand what I am trying to say here, while everyone has the ability to flame freely, junglers get a huge advantage that I have never seen mentioned, thus this post.

You cannot ping your team's drakes nor your enemies. junglers can ping many things, including the enemy laner's bounty, which is definitely a good way to flame, but we as laners cannot ping the drake or baron diff, thus having a disadvantage in the flame game.

I suggest adding the ability to ping drakes, which would even out the flame field. This would also have the secondary effect of allowing legit players to notify their team that indeed, it is drake point.

leagueoflegends,i think i'm tired of top lane,"I've been playing in top lane since 2016 and I'm seriously thinking about going to mid for one reason: top lane is tiring to play.

All tank items are very strong, if you don't play as a tank/colossus it's very stressful, you feel like you don't deal damage, while your opponent gives you tons of damage with a lot of armor.

HeartSteel, Iceborn gaunglet are examples of items that in my opinion are very strong.

See, if you don't play fiora or jax or vayne toplane, it becomes very, very stressful.

I'm thinking of moving to the mid, it's much better than the top. currently, I've been playing in the top since 2016 and I've never seen tanks deal as much damage as they do now

bounty system should activate when there is a 5000 gold lead and after 15 minutes at 3000 gold after minute 20 its 4000 gold and from min 25 onward 5000 gold.

Or wheneveri play senna, it feels like i really am the savior of the black mist, absolving the blackmist and saving the souls of the damned, rescuing them to cut down those who oppose us

leagueoflegends,Champion Select QOL Suggestion: Allow the option to feature top played/mastery champions publicly to your teamates,"It's a simple feature that I believe would help increase teamwork/communication during ranked champion selection and prematurely start cooperation between teammates.  


 If something like a smaller-scale champion mastery tab was beside or above your Ign it'd be a lot easier to coordinate proper team comps and possibly discourage people from playing an off-meta pick if their team encourages them to play one of their mains - who knows, positive reinforcement can go along way.

[Like this - but pertaining to each specific role](https://preview.redd.it/qmy09g1e8rma1.png?width=380&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=a3aed3e98b88cb15991c2c7cd8d54ac9a79fe48c)

I.E.   


Top - Shen, Renekton, Teemo

Jungle - Nidalee, Shaco, Nocturne 

Mid - Heimerdinger, Leblanc, Twisted Fate

Adc - Ezreal, Ashe, Kalista 

Support - Janna, Sona, Yummi 

&amp;#x200B;

All it takes is for one player to go   


""We could have a really good global comp played with our mains is we go Shen, Nocturne, Tf, Ashe, and Yummi ""

Or  


 ""If we went Renekton, Shaco, Leblanc, Kalista, Janna our snowball potential would be insane""

All while having the security that each person is comfortable with said champion.

Right now champion select is relatively dead but it provides valuable time for your team to prepare, could assist with helping your teammates with counters or vice versa without the worry of the person never playing them before and doing it anyways because of pressure. 

Honestly, there are a ton of benefits when it comes to teamwork, communication, positive mindset, and helps prepare for a more teamwork/objective-focused match. If there are any possible downsides just select the option to opt out of the feature? I cant think of anyways it could disrupt the gameplay -

But yummi just went back to ground zero (I would say lower even), that rework done nothing it the same either pick or banned her.

If her adc is useless, she even more useless now cause she can't just build her friendship with another feed members result in actual 5v3 game where the adc and yummi just feeding the enemies till she bond with someone else.

She the same in feeling either burst the holder or just die trying at the best, her healing and shield now stronger due to shield just not easy to break down for most classes aside from mages or assassin.

Let's be honest here, shield always outvalue the heal and now with this rework the anti-heal idea that was good counter to her isn't much of thread since she can just shield on the top of shield of ADC items which result in feed adc to be twice feed.

That what I think to be honest, that what I saw and nothing else no numbers or nerfes will changed my point of view.

**We don't get clear animations.** Just tiny red lines and him screaming **but they are often drowned out in the chaos of a fight** so players fighting him don't get a clear idea of when it starts or ends.

The only clear way is to click on him and keep our eye on a ^tiny ^line ticking down in a ^tiny ^square on the top left of the screen. **Good luck doing that in the chaos of a fight.**

Riot is adding clarity to every champion's kit, Morgana and Kat ulti's range. Stacking champs get an indicator of how much they stacked. And tons of champs have 2-3 bars under their HP that indicate when skills are ready or how long they last. And now even GP has an indicator to how many barrels he has. Meaning enemies know when to all in him when he has no barrels ready.

**Tryndamere should get the same treatment**


Like a circle or bar that indicates when the ulti starts or ends. That way it's more fair for players who fight against him.


And some Trynd players will complain that it is a huge nerf. **But deceptive/power from obscurity is not healthy nor is it fair**


If Tryndamere's winrate plummets because people now know exactly when his ulti is up/down then just buff him. 



I'm sure the majority of people would much rather have Trynd deal more damage or have lover CDs instead of having to guess when his ultimate is up or down.",jtpredator,10/03/23 09:34:14 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11naooq/riot_is_steadily_adding_qol_clarity_to_every/

leagueoflegends,"[Skilled Yuumi Rework] - My Yuumi Rework, the goal is more forced targetability and decision making","I thought I'd give a crack at a Yuumi rework so I thought I'd ask the Yuumi mains what they think. I think the main problem is that she is incentivised to stay on her teammates no matter what and making her choose between being stronger (but targetable) and weaker (but untargetable) should be a bigger emphasis. For some reason Riot want to make her more powerful when attached to allies with is insanity. Feel free to suggest some changes or take apart some aspects and keep some others.

Goals of my rework

1. Make her choose between external power and internal safety.
2. Make her more skill expressive but still usable for new players (Q will still do damage, E will still heal, ult will still be useful)

# Base stat changes:

No longer has gimped movement speed and attack range due to forced targetability. Base stats more inline with other enchanters.

# Passive: Magical Books (Up to 100 stacks)

Yuumi builds up stacks by moving and attacking, which grant her movement speed and increased damage on her spells as she moves outside an ally (not broken by combat). At full stacks her autos gain bonus range, damage and slow power. She retains these stacks until used from spells attached to an ally.

The aim of this is to make her more powerful the longer she manages to stay unattached. Making her choose between personal power or untargetability and ally buffs.

# Q: Staying with the theme of building up power when unattached (unattached: +20, attached: -20) 

**Suggestion 1:**

Unattached Q: Aiming system closer to current version, builds stacks if hit, AOE damage, reduces cooldown if hit incentivising to stay off ally for more damage.

Attached Q: Travels slower (closer to old version), consumes some stacks, and slows enemy, does reduced damage.

**Suggestion 2:**

Independent cooldowns

# W: Strength when attached to an ally (no longer has a cooldown, is based on stacks, need 100 to attach) 

**Suggestion 1:**

Yuumi now untargetable during second half of W when attaching (can be used to avoid damage, and first half of W when disattaching. This means she should hold off attaching to an ally for as long as possible utilising her off ally kit, and then use W to avoid a Naut hook for example (still gets caught if reacting too late). The tradeoff is she is forced off her ally after a certain amount of time.

Attaching has a stack threshold, meaning she has to do stuff off her ally to attach again.

Yuumi can disattach prematurely before being kicked off for lack of stacks, to auto and Q and build more stacks to reattach immediately and stay on for longer. This also makes her less predictable in when she will come off her ally. 

Attach to an ally for a duration giving them the bonus movement speed from your passive stacks. 

Duration is limited.

Hopefully the aim with the passive is that you build your passive, attach to an ally. When your stacks run out you are forced off your ally until you get stacks again. Attaching to an ally procs aery (from movespeed transfer). 

# E: Healing is back (unattached: +5 stacks per 10% own max hp taken, attached: -30 stacks per heal)

Unattached: 

Passive: Yuumi redirects some damage taken to her book building stacks

Active: Yuumi heals herself

Attached: 

Passive: Damage taken by anchor is split proportionally based on %max hp between Yuumi and her anchor

Active: Heal is proportionally split between Yuumi and anchor. (Yuumi not affected by anchor antiheal, or lifesteal, damage taken by shielded ally will hit unshielded Yuumi's health)

# R: Like old ult (can't change direction of waves) + more skill expression. (unattached +10 stacks per enemy per wave hit, attached no stacks lost)

**Suggestion 1:**

Make her 3 basic abilities select a wave type during her ult, kind of like an advanced Nunu E (she won't be able to cast other abilities during her ult), this could be: 

Q Waves - Slows enemy based on passive stacks (consistent but weaker), high damage relative to other waves

W Wave - Will root enemies moving towards Yuumi hit with 3 consecutive W waves (prevents chasing enemies since it only roots people running towards her),  low damage relative to other waves 

E Wave - Shields allies with a stackable shield (stacking up to 3 times), medium damage compared to other waves. Shield value increased based on stacks left. Anchored ally gains movement speed based on passive stacks remaining.

**Suggestion 2:**

Hitting more enemies per wave gives more effects:

Hit one enemy, they are slowed (prevents picking single players with a root), damage scales per stack

Hit two enemies, they are slowed and slow stacks per wave, and per passive stack

Hit three enemies, anyone caught in the 3rd consecutive wave that hits a target will be rooted (regardless of how many times they themselves have been hit)",NidhoggsEgoAccount,13/03/23 05:54:41 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11pr33j/skilled_yuumi_rework_my_yuumi_rework_the_goal_is/
leagueoflegends,As a Loe Elo Player i really do miss Smurf Q..,"last season was way more enjoyable.. i know smurf Q was a problem itself, but alteast low elo had protection ever since preseason i got atleast 2-3 smurfs a day on like 5-6 games a day..

its not fun at all jsut having someone in the game taking over it so often

most smurf dosnt care or respect the elo were there are smurfing they BM or throw games on purpuse because they dont care-- they only care if its going good

and having this back now on a dayli base ist just a terrible feeling i cant be the only one things that way. It isnt even to have them on ur own team i mean jeah free win but at the end of the dont we play for our own enjoymant???

balanced matchmaking is imposible like that IMO

at the end this is just a post about me letting of some steam after getting back to back games destroyed by lv30 acc\`s it wont change anything but i can go sleep now that i let it out. good night",trueEmya,13/03/23 06:40:45 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11ps9s6/as_a_loe_elo_player_i_really_do_miss_smurf_q/

leagueoflegends,Clash Consolidation Bracket Leavers - Should they receive a punishment?,"Shouldn't there be a punishment for forfeiting clash after the first game?   


I've encountered that people leave after loosing the first game. This usually ends up with my team waiting for 30-40 mintues before the last game goes through.   
This has happened yesterday, today and at previous tournaments during 2022 and is very booring for the clash experience. I get that people would like to compete for good rewards, but this kind of makes the bracket very booring. 

I'm playing in tier 3/4.

Maybe teams players could not participate in the next clash tournament if they forfeit after the first game?",FredensTyv,13/03/23 03:08:51 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11pmuu6/clash_consolidation_bracket_leavers_should_they/

leagueoflegends,Idea for Malzahar,"Idea I made for Malzahar to be an RTS champion while keeping his basic kit. Most of this post's length is about the Voidlings.

# NEW P - Zz'rot Swarm

INNATE - Strategist: Champion can directly select and control his summoned units.  
\- Allows multi-unit selection  
\- Pressing ""Lock Camera"" centers on and selects your champion  
\- Pressing ""Center Camera"" centers on the selected unit

INNATE: Dealing damage with abilities spawns a Voidling near the target  
\- Limited to 1 Voidling spawned per ability cast  
\- Limited to 4 Voidlings leashed to Malzahar within 1350 units  
\- Limited to 6/10/14 Voidlings globally (based on level)  
\- Limted to 1 Super Voidling globally

# Q - Call of the Void

ACTIVE: unchanged  
NEW SECONDARY ACTIVE: Place a portal that periodically spawns Voidlings  
\- Voidlings spawned this way default to lane-pushing  
\- Available while primary active is on cooldown  
\- Has own cooldown of 30/28/26/24/22 sec; 25 mana cost  
\- Portal lasts 30-90 sec and spawns Voidlings every 15/15/10/10/10 seconds  
\- Portal has 1/2/3/4/5 HP, takes 1 damage from champion sources, and is instantly destroyed by turrets or abilities with silencing effects

# NEW W - Void Shift

ACTIVE:  Gain a spellshield that grants 50/60/70/80/90% damage reduction and spell immunity that breaks and lingers for 0.25 sec after resisting an effect/taking damage. Lasts 5 seconds if unbroken.
\- \[40/45/50/55/60 Mana, 24/21/18/15/12 sec CD\]

# E - Malefic Visions

PASSIVE: unchanged  
NEW PASSIVE: Refreshing this ability on targets counts as an extra spell cast  
ACTIVE: unchanged

# R - Nether Grasp

ACTIVE: unchanged

# VOIDLING INFO

\- No longer have a lifetime  
\- Any Voidling that kills 10 enemies becomes a Super Voidling if there isn't already one  
\- Voidlings display their kill count as a buff  
\- All Voidlings are leashed to Malzahar unless leash limits are full, manually controlled, or entering combat  
\- The Super Voidling can summon Voidlings when slaying enemies while pushing a lane, summoning and leashing up to 2/3/4  
\- All Voidlings lose 25-45 movespeed (based on level) if more than 1600 units away from Malzahar or a Super Voidling

Control hierarchy:   
1 - User input  
2 - Autonomous; following and defending leash target  
3 - Autonomous; pushing nearest lane  
4 - Idle (no targets in vision and leash limits reached)

Autonomous attack priority:  
1 - Nether Grasp's target within 1400 units  
2 - Malefic Visions' target within 1350 units while leashed to Malzahar  
3 - Malefic Visions' target within 1000 units while leashed to Super Voidling  
4 - Malzahar's attack target within 900 units while leashed to Malzahar  
5 - Nearest enemy

STATS (Voidling)  
\- Base stats unchanged  
\- +10% Malzahar's max HP as HP  
\- 34% Malzahar's total AD + 20% AP as attack damage  
\- Rest of Voidling stats and behavior unchanged from live.

STATS (Super Voidling)  
\- 5x Voidling base stats (except AD, speed, and attack speed, which are the same)  
\- 150 attack range  
\- +50% Malzahar's max HP as HP  
\- 45% total AD + 27% AP attack damage  
\- 50% AoE spell resistance  
\- Prioritized after lane minions by towers

# VOIDLING ABILITIES

\- Can be used only while Voidlings are selected  
\- Rank based on Malzahar's ability rank

Q - Slash \[no cost\]  
ACTIVE: Reset attack timer and strike with 75 increased range  
\- 4 second cooldown  
\- Super Voidling: attack deals area damage in a 55° cone in its attack range

W - Leap \[no cost\]  
ACTIVE: Leap 300 units, increased by 10/20/30/40/50% towards Malefic Vision victims  
\- 10/9/8/7/6 sec cooldown  
\- can buffer Slash during Leap

E - Malefic Visions (Super Voidling only)  
ACTIVE: cast Malefic Visions from the Super Voidling  
\- This ability costs mana and goes on cooldown as if cast from Malzahar

R - Evolve (Voidling only)  
ACTIVE: Become a Super Voidling, destroying any active one  
\- Requires 10 kills by Voidlings

R - Heed the Call (Super Voidling Only)  
ACTIVE: Teleport to Malzahar or an active Portal, bringing along leashed Voidlings  
\- Cooldown: 180/150/120",Omicron43,08/03/23 08:07:33 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11lg7u1/idea_for_malzahar/
leagueoflegends,Iron to Diamond... EugeneBeets League," 

Hey yal!

I'm excited to announce that I'm starting a journey from Iron to Diamond, and I want to share it with you all. I started playing League of Legends way back in 2015, but it wasn't until season 8 that I really started to get into it, and that was only for a season or two.

I've always been a casual player, but I've decided to take things a bit more seriously now. I want to prove to myself that with some hard work and the right approach, anything is possible. That's why I'm starting this journey, to see just how far I can climb the ranks.

I know virtually no one is going to think I have any business even bothering to try this, but I invited both supports and haters to follow along :) 

I'll be posting daily updates on my progress in a Reddit thread called r/EugeneBeetsLeague. I'll share my victories, my defeats, and everything in between. I want to be transparent about my journey and share my experiences with others who are on the same path.

I'm also considering streaming my games. I think it would be a fun way to connect with other players and share my gameplay in real-time. So, if that's something you're interested in, please let me know in the comments. I would love the support/tips in chat.

In the end, this journey is about more than just climbing the ranks. It's about pushing myself to be better, learning from my mistakes, and having fun along the way. So, whether you're a seasoned player or just starting out, I would love your support in this and hope to talk with you in the future!",FullMindEmptyPockets,11/03/23 06:10:19 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11o2gms/iron_to_diamond_eugenebeets_league/
leagueoflegends,Why is it so outdated?,"So I used to love playing LoL. I used to play it every single day, but eventually stopped playing it for around 4 years. I came back to it a couple of weeks ago and it was a bit disappointing to see how many champions were still looking super outdated, I would have thought that by now most of the older champions would have at least gotten a visual review. I was specially excited when I saw the mobile game I thought that meant that the champions on PC would had been updated as well but no, I still enjoy the game but everything looks a bit the same as it always had… Why aren’t there different versions of the normal 5v5 map by now? Or better champion models, perhaps little cutscenes or animations about lore per character like other Mobas do. 

I don’t know, I think considering the massive success of the game I was expecting that to show a bit more… I think they need to make a big update of the game in general. It looks a bit weird specially comparing newer champions with old ones",lyingchalice,12/03/23 10:52:37 PM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11pgci6/why_is_it_so_outdated/
leagueoflegends,KDA is one single parameter.,"As per title. KDA doesn't tell you how the game progressed, nor how everyone on the team has played.  Many of you are smarter than this, and won't behave so illogically. 

If an opposing bruiser or assassin gets fed, they will delete your fragile teammates, even if they were not responsible for bringing that enemy to that state. On that note, harassing the person responsible is not helpful either.

Spam pinging or sending rude messages in chat only disrupts teamwork and reduces chances of winning. Please remember that your teammates are people as well. Please, just be kind. The world is already unkind enough.",Clear_Yogurtcloset12,10/03/23 11:19:47 PM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11nrwlq/kda_is_one_single_parameter/

leagueoflegends,What was the funniest/best insult or flame you've seen in game?,"Not to promote any more toxicity in the community but there have been some pretty funny insults/flaming I have seen while playing.

I just finished an Aram and we had an Ashe that plays waaayy back and just uses her W to damage.

Our Illaoi got pissed after a teamfight where we all died except her and then immediately asked in chat:

""-What is your purpose?
-
-
- exactly?
-""

I laughed hysterically for a minute after I read that. 

Maybe it's because it seemed like she was extremely offended by Ashe's way of playing. Or maybe its just a new insult that i haven't heard.

leagueoflegends,I played Milio in PBE and had an idea of how a gamemode centered around his Q would look like,"For those who aren't aware, Milio has arrived in the PBE about a day ago. While i thought that his kit itself was interesting, what really caught my eye was his Q, ""Ultra Mega Fire Kick"". He essentially uses one of his Fuemigos as a ball and kicks it forward, if it comes into contact with a target, it'll knock the target back. 

At first, when I saw this, and after hearing how he groans if he misses an enemy, i thought: ""It would be interesting if he celebrated when killing an enemy with it."" And then, shortly after that, i thought: ""Wait, was there ever a soccer-themed gamemode in League?""

That's when the idea came to me. What if there was a gamemode centered around using Milio's Q to knock a scuttle crab or Rammus (ok) into a soccer goal/pit of sorts? I don't know if the name ""Rammus-ball"" sounds that good, so ""Scuttleball"" was the next best thing. 

It would look like this: one person plays Milio on each team, one person plays Yasuo and serves as the goal keeper, Yasuo using his W, Wind Wall, to deflect the scuttler away. Syndra would serve as the defender and use her W, Force Of Will, to pick up the scuttler and toss it away into the enemy team's side. 

I came up with this a few hours ago and i haven't been able to get it out of my mind ever since. I'd like to hear some feedback on this, because I think it could really be a lot of fun if it was an actual rotating gamemode.",febntom,09/03/23 08:34:36 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11mdhyx/i_played_milio_in_pbe_and_had_an_idea_of_how_a/

leagueoflegends,It feels like every mage rework aims to make them late-game scaling champions.,"Viktor, Syndra, Aurelion, now Azir. Not every mage should become Veigar. Mages already have access to very strong scaling builds like Roa+arch+rab+void, gathering storm, etc.

What mages players want is not more scaling playstyles. What they want is not to be entirely reliant on stuns and slows for their safety, that can be nullified with a correct rune setup; they also want a diverse itemization that goes beyond ""will my team buy anti-heal or is it up to me ?"".

At this point, I already know what to expect for the next mage update :  
1) Make their bread&amp;butter ability very weak early. If possible, make it extremely low-cooldown on lvl5.  
2) Give them exciting stacks mechanics that reward them for participating, but actually make it much easier to stack from last-hits.  
3) Just remove any incentive to roam, really.

If I am not going to roam and I have no kill pressure, then I have no incentive to contest the wave. I will sit back with a bunch of mana and last-hit, take tp, give up map pressure and let the jungler handle it on his own, but force 4v2 plays bot. Then, my scaling will just bypass the durability patch eventually.

I don't think we should update every mage with this ""late-game scaling"" mindset.",Plantarbre,08/03/23 04:45:22 PM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11lr3hz/it_feels_like_every_mage_rework_aims_to_make_them/

By highest damage in a single rotation, I don't necessarily mean the overall best scaling assassin (that's probably Kassadin), but the best one who can deal the most damage in a single combination of their abilities, if they were theoretically landing all their abilities onto the enemy.

Everything I've read says this means your MMR is lower than your rank and you need to win more to help it, but after an 8 game win streak, it just got worse.

leagueoflegends,Skin ideas for every champ - J,"Hello everyone!

It's time for J, here we go:

**Janna**

*Faerie Court*: Right off the bat with the newest skin line, Janna is 100% flawless fit here, she strongly brings the fairy vibe and just generally a good pick here I reckon.

*Ocean Song*: Watery effects would work just the same with her abilities, a water-tornado on Q, bubble on her E. I decided on OS instead of Pool Party because it's more...idk girly? I see this one fitting her slightly more honestly.

*Coven*: A more mysterious, little bit evil skin, but that's exactly why I chose it, to contrast the first two and well, all of her skins in general, and bring a bit of fresh air. (See what I did there?) Also the forest witch theme is just something that matches her style regardless.

*Cafe Cuties*: Aaaand right back to the cute girly skins lmao. She's just a good fit here too, not much I can say.

*Dragon Trainer*: Works well, just switch her bird with a little dragon. Easy, done. They soar the skies together. Can add some fiery effects to the nado perhaps.

**Jarvan IV**

*Ashen King*: I found this one one of the more fitting aesthetics for him, I think it could be great.

*Warden*: He's full of armor, this makes sense.

*Astronaut*: Dropping flags on planets, creating a crater when he ults.

*Odyssey*: Another space skin, but here, he's the leader of a space countrey.

**Jax**

*Justicar*: Focusing more on the light theme of his weapon, giving some yellow 'holy' effects to boost them further.

*Camper*: His weapon basically becomes a long stick with marshmellows on the end, give him some camper outfit and when he activates the W, it makes sense cause he just put them into fire that's why the stick flames. On the recall, obviously he sits next to a campfire and holds his stick in. Kinda simple but fun skin.

*Might Dragon*: Again - trying to do something with the light/fiery effects of his staff, I thought of this Dragonmancer skin, I think it could match his style as this sort of elemental dragon warrior channeling his flaming powers into his weapon.

*Legendary Urf Champion*: Urf the Manatee's chosen champion who is the only one powerful enough to be able to wield the infinite power of the golden spatule.

**Jayce**

*Battle Ram*: An Anima Squad skin, I think he works with this animal themed superhero group fantasy, his weapon works great with it, he got the looks too, maybe change the ram with something else, that's what I could think of at the moment.

*Odyssey*: A space style techy fighter, his weapon works really well here too. Idk he kinda has a bit of Guardians of the Galaxy thing going on, maybe it's just me.

*Empyrean*: So Empyrean imo is mostly meant for flashly-badass-killstreaker-visually cool ability using champs and Jayce's electric spell effects could go well into this, just imagine Forsaken Jayce, but switch out the red with Emp's RGB effects.

*Pulsefire*: I don't think this really needs an explanation.

**Jhin**

*Crime City Nightmare*: Oh boy, here we go. It wasn't easy choosing skins that fit Jhin's perfection and suit him well enough, but here's one I thought might be cool; a dark, criminal bounty hunter. Basic Crime City isn't evil/mysterious/artsy enough, but this one is, plus if you look at CCN TF or Shaco, you'll also realise how good Jhin's mask could be here.

Fright Night: Somewhat similar dark murderer theme, but more into the scary, maniac, psychotic serial killer vibe. Thought of Draven and that's when I felt this might have the potential.

Arcana: One of the most artistic, storytelling- and splash art heavy skin lines out there, natural pick for him. And they also have one of the best colour palettes.

Pentakill: I know it's bad because it's not quadra, but Pentakill is seriously one of the best picks you can get for Jhin. Music is important for Jhin since it's a form of art and from all the music themed skins in league, combined with the visuals, aesthetics of the skins that are part of them, you can't get a better fit for Jhin than Pentakill. Just think of that elevated rock-metal orchestration his ult would get. Plus, Pentakill's latest line is chapter III, correct? And what comes after that? Cherry on top, there you have it.

**Jinx**

*Vandal/Road Warrior*: Probably the most fitting champion for this whole skin line with her weapons and personality.

*Dragon Trainer*: All three of her weapons become different little dragons: one shoots lots of small flickers, one can spit lightning, the other big fireballs. Even her traps could be little dragons that bite onto the enemy and her traps do flaming DoT anyways so that works too. Ult would be a gigantic fireball or maybe another bigger dragon oooor an egg.

*Goth*: I could imagine her as one especially after the emotional damage she received in Arcane.

*Cyber Pop*: Rebecca.

&amp;#x200B;

leagueoflegends,MMR is so low but winrate is high?,"Title basically says it all.

I’m currently Platinum 2 75 LP. I’m gaining about 17-18 LP per win, but then losing 25-27 LP per loss. 

I know MMR fluctuates based on winrate, but it just hasn’t for me. I have a 59% winrate in soloqueue overall, and a 60% winrate on my main (Evelynn). 

I tend to go on several win streaks - yesterday I had a six game win streak before I lost a whopping 27 LP the last game I played (but only gaining 17-18 LP per win).

Does anyone have some information on this? It’s getting a bit discouraging to climb because of it. Thanks.",merilovely,10/03/23 10:43:45 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11ncbfn/mmr_is_so_low_but_winrate_is_high/
leagueoflegends,Skin ideas for every champ - M,"Hello everyone!

Time for M! Let's begin!

**Malphite**

*Guardian of the Sands*: With this one, his back that's usually tall and spiky due to his model, could be a pyramid and sand could be falling off of him. Since he's, you know, just a big rock, can't really add more to this idea...

*Bloodstone*: His body would be made up of this red crystal that Bs Taric uses.

*Kaiju*: Given he is a gigantic fella - by lore at least - this seems like an optimal choice.

*Worldbreaker*: Very similar idea to the previous one.

**Malzahar**

*Meowzahar*: An army of cats!

*Dragon Master*: Kinda like Swain's skin with the same name, voidlings are dragons and his ult is basically breathing fire. Might add smaller wings to Malza.

*Alien invader*: Voidlings are aliens...like, even more. Since he's levitating, he could have some kinda space suit with jet packs.

*Guardian of the Sands*: Been using this one a lot lately, but can't miss out on the opportunity to use scarabs for the voidlings. His clothing with a recolour is perfectly good for a desert setting.

*Praetorian*: Voidlings are little droids that seek out targets. Once they find them, Prae. Malza uses his deadly laser breath to terminate them.

*Trick-or-Treat*: Some kinda costume for Malz, voidlings are little jack-o'-lanterns with spider legs. Actually, Malza could have a j.o.l. for head as well.

**Maokai**

*Elderwood*: I mean, it's obvious to me.

*Old God*: Ivern got one, I see no issue in giving Mao one too. It fits him just the same.

*Spirit Blossom*: Blooming cherry tree. I know, it's a banger isn't it.

**Master Yi**

*Void Corrupted*: His goggles would become actual eyes. Void sh\*t, you know. Maybe the knife-boots could also transform into talons on his leg. I could also imagine the sword becoming a part of his arm. Just going wild on this one.

*Cyber Pop*: An enviroment where his goggles would make sense and not look (as) ridiculous.

*Shockblade*: His style fits into the skin line, plus his Q could be an actual lightning striking multiple targets.

*Dragonslayer*: I found it a good match. Kinda like a less bulky tryndamere.

**Miss Fortune**

*Heartseeker*: Works with her charming nature and she has heart elements in her abilities already so why not build something on that.

*Project*: She has...guns. It works and she's a classic old champ, how does she not have a P. skin yet?

*Crystal Rose*: A very elegant skin line, looks like something I could see MF in. May even put two of those roses at the barrel of her guns.

*Cafe Cuties*: She's a cutie enough for this.

*Dragonfire*: Kinda like Dragon Sorceress Zyra. In a similar fashion, serpent-like dragons are twisted on her arms and she uses them as guns. They breath fireballs in place of bullets and the ultimate could actually be kinda like a flamethrower even. Plus, if you've seen DS Zyra, you know MF's ""model"" would also like this skin a lot.

**Mordekaiser**

*Battle Boss*: By default, he's a final boss in the lore. So this is a good fit.

*Toydekaiser*: Emperor Zurg intensifies\*

*Blackfrost*: It's just one of those cool skins, frozen armor, sort of lich king vibes I guess.

*Shan Hai Scrolls*: Can't give a lot of reasons to this one, Nau has one of these skins, there are some similarities between them... I just think it'd be a good fit.

*Mecha*: Big, scary, armored dudes always work with this skin line. He has project but that doesn't give me mehca vibes so I thought it's not a problem.

**Morgana**

*Faerie Court*: Again, as with Kayle, they are both about having lots of wings, so a skin line that uses lots of butterfly wings definitely works.

*Arcana*: Gave Kayle one too, gonna do the same for her. Together they could have a great splash, that's something like their deafult splash plus Xayah and Rakan's Arcana splash.

*Debonair*: As with lissandra, an evening dress is perfect for her.

*Soulstealer*: Her passive is called soul siphon, but regardless of that, in general I believe this fits her well, some torquise effects on her spells, a look between Vayne and Vlad and it works very well.

*Dragon Sorceress*: Lot's of dragon themed skins today, huh. Dragon wings and fiery spells. Could also be some kind of Dragonmancer skin and then her Q could be like Storm Dragon Lee's.

&amp;#x200B;

leagueoflegends,I shouldn't have to use third party tools to know if someone took bone plating or not.,"In top lane for example, your entire approach to level 1 play can change based on whether they take BP or not. As it stands, the only way to find out (outside of opgg) is to test proc it. In my opinion, it should be visible in the loading screen on the pages you flip through like mastery and rank or it should expand when you mouse hover their keystone. Ik it's not always consequential to the lane, but it should be visible imo for convenience and for the one time it does matter. Other examples are cookies  (knowing whether they're actually OOM or just waiting for cookies) or cosmic insight (properly timing summs).

leagueoflegends,Rod of ages and Seraph's embrace are stupidly designed items,"What was the thought process behind creating two items that allow AP mages, especially in mid-lane that build a rod of ages combined with Seraph's embrace to go from normal mage health to pretty much tank levels of health of 2 items whilst still getting +110AP?

Not all champions can abuse these items to the same extent but the majority of AP mid-lane mages can just rush these items and still do a bunch of damage whilst being pretty much impossible to kill in a 1v1 scenario since mages usually have some sort of long duration cc or escape in their kit.

Especially champions like Asol that has pretty much zero cooldowns now as well as Veigar can abuse these items to massive extents.

Mages should have high AP damage but not the ability to have like 3500 health of 2 items.",SnowMacaronss,10/03/23 06:44:15 PM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11nlqfw/rod_of_ages_and_seraphs_embrace_are_stupidly/
leagueoflegends,Why is Sion getting nerfed tenacity in ARAM ?,"Sion has a -20 tenacity modifier in ARAM, and afaik is the only champ in the game with this. Why is it the case ? The champ is just awful to play if the enemy team has a bit of CC. And since they nerfed tenacity stacking, you cant even try to compensate, you will be screwed anyway.

  
Apart from the tenacity, Sion is already hard nerfed in ARAM:

* \+10% damage received, -10%  damage done
* \-20 ability haste (with Sett, they are the only two melee champs getting AH nerfed, while the others are Ashe, Sona, Ziggs, Seraph and Teemo, which are spamming their abilities)
* \-20% shield done

The tenacity one just feels overkill, and makes the champ one of the worst I ever played in this mode. I would rather have much more damage received/damage done nerfs than tenacity.

So I asked my friend what that was about and he said that happens when someone types ""/deafen"" into the chat. So I asked if he received the same message for me and he said that disabling the chat from the menu doesn't do that.

He then insisted that I should do that instead, because it's better that my team ""knows"" that I can't read their messages or whatever, but why should that be my burden? I don't want to run the risk of forgetting to type that and read something toxic every single game.

leagueoflegends,Early view on Yuumi and Azir data for 13.5,"Hi there.

As I was adding some improvements to my current data and also adding more data to show you, I got the idea to release individual posts for new and reworked champs as they tend to get more data faster and so I can release them earlier than the overall post.

[Early View Yuumi Patch 13.5 - Deadmansplate](https://deadmansplate.com/data/early-view-yuumi-patch-13-5/)

[Early View Azir Patch 13.5 - Deadmansplate](https://deadmansplate.com/data/early-view-azir-patch-13-5/)

&amp;#x200B;

A very short summary:

Yuumi: QEW max mostly (QEW could have niche potential), Moonstone + Ardent and no boots. She is on the strong side and could take a nerf.

Azir: WQE, Nashors is usable again (not 1st). He can reach the same WR as last patch if people play him right, but he most likely still needs buffs. I doubt he will be as dominant in pro play still (I hope so), which would leave more room for Riot to buff him (\~48% would be my goal and then waiting till we see pro play).

&amp;#x200B;

p.s.: my other posts should go live tomorrow. As the patches got larger this year, I have to look up and write a lot more. Also some champs like Rumble and Qiyana but also items like Cosmic Drive don't get as much data in time.

I will update my posts every 24-48 hours and try to do that till the next patch arrives.

leagueoflegends,Regarding the yorick nerfs,"Yorick got nerfed pretty hard this patch - both directly, through reducing bonus ghoul damage from his e, and indirectly, through making tabis block... everything in his kit. The justification from riot was his ""uninteractive"" e/ghouls combo, especially in ravenous hydra/lethality-based builds (i.e., his best build atm).

Here's a list of the ways you can interact with yorick e:
1. Dodge it
2. Stay out of range
3. Stop yorick from setting up graves.
4. All in yorick when he has no ghouls or graves
5. Auto attack the ghouls.
6. Build wardens mail or ninja tabis
7. Pick irelia, jax, kled, mordekaiser...

It's silly to claim this is uninteractive. Yorick e is among the most interactive abilities in the game.

Most champions are balanced around people knowing their counterplay. Yorick is balanced around people mot knowing how he works, making him almost unplayable versus someone who does. 

If riot is really dead set on discouraging yorick players from going damage-heavy builds, they should either target the problem items (ravenous hydra, prowlers claw), or combine a nerf to that playstyle with a compensation buff to his bruiser playstyle - which has been underperforming for a while.",Aether_Phoenix,10/03/23 02:14:25 PM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11ngt94/regarding_the_yorick_nerfs/
leagueoflegends,ezreal's fast reaction,,Xhl9000,10/03/23 01:49:11 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11myn8e/ezreals_fast_reaction/
leagueoflegends,There needs to be a separate queue for norms for people trying to learn new champions/roles.,"Right now norms' win condition is determinate on who mains their champ more. I find it incredibly difficult, at this point, to learn anything with a new champion when my lane opponent is a 3 million mastery irelia, riven, sett, katarina, camille, yasuo, etc. Additionally, I've noticed lately that the changes in the meta over the years have shifted to encourage a ""role main."" If you play top the most, for example, you can ""only"" do well top (for a lack of better words). Every lane has shifted to have a lot of nuance in its own playstyle. I'm not entirely saying that this is a bad thing, but it takes a whole lot more practice to learn the nuances of each role vs just learning the nuances of one specific role. And this practice cannot usually be acquired in normal games, as your lane opponent is more likely to be more equipped with the knowledge of these nuances if you are playing off-role. (and it sure as shit cannot be replicated in 'co-op vs ai' games)

My proposal is that a new queue be introduced where champions you have mastery 4+ with are disabled. This would not only be a great addition for new players, but would also encourage a wider champion pool for veteran players. It will even improve the quality of regular norms, as it promotes more fair matchups in terms of skill. Plus, it has the added bonus of less toxicity on average, as people being flamed for being ""bad"" have the option to queue up in the secondary normal queue.",Smileyfacehi121,09/03/23 09:59:29 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11mffw4/there_needs_to_be_a_separate_queue_for_norms_for/

leagueoflegends,List of ALL instances of damage affected by Steelcaps (Ninja Tabi) before and after the change in 13.5,"In modern League, damage can be tagged as more than just belonging to a basic attack; Riot can control whether the individual instance of damage also counts as a spell, a proc or whether it should trigger on-hit effects or lifesteal for example. These tags and properties are pretty hidden as they're supposed to be mostly intuitive. As a reminder, Plated Steelcaps' passive **mitigates the damage taken from *attacks* by 12%**.  
Until today's patch, Steelcaps' effect was rather scared when it saw damage tagged as coming from an attack or attack-like hit additionally have the tag to count as spell or proc damage. That changes now, and I compiled a list of how Steelcaps interacts with **every** unique instance of champion damage pre-and post patch below:

###Affected by Plated Steelcaps's 12% reduction before the patch already:

* **ALL basic attacks except from turrets** (without bonus damage from systemic on-hit effects or procs)

* Runaan's Hurricane bolts

* Akshan P's 2nd hit

* Akshan E hits

* Aphelios follow up attacks (after both Sniper/Flamethrower Q and R hits)

* Aphelios Camibrum (Sniper) first mark damage (on both Q and R follow up)

* Aphelios Severum (Pistol) Q (Onslaught) hits

* Aphelios Infernum (Flamethrower) attacks against primary target (excluding pass-trough and splash damage)

* Aphelios Infernum (Flamethrower) unique Runaan's missiles hits to their primary targets

* Aphelios Crescendum (Boomerang) main attack hit (excluding the many bonus mini-boomerang hits)

* Ashe Q (including unique Runaan's hits spread randomly onto nearby targets)

* Caitlyn Headshots (but not the trapped bonus damage)

* ~~Camille Q's true damage portion (but not converted Sheen)~~ [5] (there is actually a hilarious note on this, see below)

* Corki P (both physical and magic damage is reduced)

* Draven Q's full damage

* Fiora E (both hits)

* Galio P to primary target (converted to magic damage)

* Graves' attacks (all pellets)

* Jayce ranged W (Hypercharge) attacks

* Jhin FOUR

* Jinx Q (Fishbones rockets) to primary target (including unique Runaan's missiles primary target hits)

* Kayle base E physical portion

* Kayle Arisen E physical to primary target and AOE targets

* Kled W's last hit's additional damage

* Lucian P's 2nd hit

* Malphite W against primary target

* Master Yi P's 2nd hit

* Nautilus P attack's full damage

* Nocturne P to primary target

* Nunu P AOE cleave damage

* Pantheon Empowered W all hits

* Quinn P attack's full damage

* Rek'Sai unborrowed Q (Queen's Wrath)'s to primary target

* Renekton W (both versions all hits)

* Rengar P leap attack (incl. via R)

* Rengar Q

* Samira P on-CC flurry attack all hits

* Sett P attacks

* Sett Q attacks

* Shaco P attack

* Shaco Q attack

* Shaco R (clone) attacks

* Shyvana human Q first hit

* Sivir W initial hit

* Sylas P to primary target

* Twitch R (both selected target and AOE)

* Udyr E (stun) attack

* Urgot W hits

* Vi E to primary target [3]

* Viego double-attacks against spell-marked enemies (Q passive) both hits

* Viego Q passive bonus damage triggered when hitting spell-marked enemies

* Wukong W (clone) attacks

* Xayah P attack to primary target

* Xin Zhao Q all attacks

* Yasuo Q (thrust, spin and whirlwind) to first/closest target

* Yone P (both physical and magic damage is reduced)

* Yone Q (thrust and dash/whirlwind) to first/closest target

* Zeri Q (all hits, including 3-missile version during R)

* Zeri EQ (pierce AOE hits against all targets)

* **This list is comprehensive. If a special attack is not mentioned here, it has its original 100% AD physical damage portion reduced but not the bonus damage. This is unchanged.**

 * Examples of this so they can be found by CTRL + F: Aatrox P, Akali P, Ekko E, Gragas W, Fizz W, Jarvan P, Jax W, Kassadin W, Kha'Zix P, Leona Q, Ornn Brittle clap, Shen Q, Sion P, Udyr Q, Ziggs P, Zoe P

###Now also affected by Ninja Tabi's 12% reduction after the patch:

* *All of the above are affected still.*

* Heartsteel item proc

* Annie R attacks [2]

* Warwick Q

* Warwick R all hits

* Wukong Q, including from clone [1]

* Yorick Q [1]

* Yorick E leap attacks of ghouls [2]

* Yorick R maiden attack (succ) [2]

###[Notes]

* [1] This empowered attack stopped being reduced by Plated Steelcaps' passive when it was changed to trigger spell effects in patch 11.21 (11.19 for Nasus Q). That unintended change is now reverted.

* [2] These pet hits are tagged as Basic Attack damage. Feels unintuitive to me that they'll be reduced by Tabis now since most other pets' attacks (e.g. Heimer turrets, Shaco boxes, Zyra plants) still aren't. Discuss, maybe?

* [3] Vi E triggers spell effects but the trigger isn't on the attack's damage

* [4] Fizz Q used to be affected until last patch (13.4) where it finally got the innate ability to trigger spell effects. The hit's magic damage is only proc so it's otherwise unaffected.

* [5] **Update:** Camille Q2 interacts with Tabi weirdly because she abuses her target's buff slots for functionality and thus whether the True Damage portion gets reduced or not depends on the order of Tabis and the conversion buff in the target's buff slots (pretty technical, just take this as a fact for now), and on whether or not the initially started physical Q2 hit gets reduced. Because Q2's physical damage wasn't reduced by Tabi between 11.21 and today's patch 13.5, the true damage portion wasn't reduced either. Now, the true damage portion is affected again but **only** if the Tabi **reduction on the physical damage happens before the conversion** of the temporary buff Camille Q2 puts on her target creates the true damage instance in order of buff slots. **Both Q2 physical and true damage are now reduced by Tabis again** under normal circumstances. When Tabis is bought or acquired under unusual circumstances (buying while you have a couple temporary buffs running on you, or Viego swapping his inventory during combat a couple of times) the **conversion can happen before Tabis reduces** the Q2 physical damage, so **then the True damage is not reduced**.

 Here's a clip to prove this fact, if you care to download 19MB: https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/969264440602132491/1083195448409468968/2023-03-09_02-11-13.mp4

 Tabis itself doesn't reduce true damage. I made a bunch of comments wrongly stating the fact because I only had experimental testing (from before 11.21) where it reduced Camille Q2's true damage and that was my only true damage attack to test with. In hindsight I should have known something was up here, because Old Stoneplate self-buff had a similar reducing mechanic affecting Camille Q2's true damage. My bad.

 *Camille Q2's true damage being reduced by Tabis again was intended originally (though I don't know under what circumstances that design decision came to be) and is intended now.*

###Champion damage instances that were and still are unaffected but may be worth noting:

(This list isn't comprehensive but I'll keep expanding it to accomodate your questions in the comments)

* Some special attacks like Jax R and Aatrox passive apply bonus damage on-hit or post-apply that counts as proc and is unaffected. Yes this is a bit inconsistent with e.g. Kled W4 whose also doing a chunk of additional damage separately but has it all tagged as BasicAttack.  
It's very much up to the special attack on how it's handled right now, might be worth to look into a consistency pass in the future. If it triggers spell effects via an extra instance of damage (Jax W, Ekko E), only the base physical damage of the attack is ever affected.

* MF passive damage (used to be Basic Attack and thus reduced a long time ago, got the proc tag because she one-shot Zyra plants which was not okay, lost the Basic Attack tag a few patches ago because of Navori so it won't return to being reduced by Tabi now).

* Some special attacks deal entirely increasted/modified damage in a single instance (Draven Q, Nautilus P, Quinn P, Nidalee CougarQ, Darius W), others as noted right above deal additional non-attack damage (Riven P, MF P, Jax W). Tabi reduces the former's damage by 12% in their entirety regardless of how the champion's AD scales into them, and doesn't reduce the latter's additional damage.

* Twisted Fate W's attack part is 0 damage, the entire magic damage including the AD scaling is just one big instance of spell damage.

* Evelynn E (both versions) may trigger on-hit effects, but are only spells, not attacks.

---

###TL:DR:

* If it feels like an attack and it comes from a champion it's **actually** always going to be reduced now, at least part of the damage based on how the hit made up. That includes attacks cast entirely as a spell, independent of the attack time cycle (e.g. Fiora Q, Irelia Q, Ezreal Q).

* GP Q poke is actually reduced now when you build Tabis (previously you just got the armor). The Sheen bonus damage is still unaffected though, so is barrel splash of course.

* Yorick's kit gets several damage hits reduced now that weren't before (Shovel Bonk (Q), Ghoul leap attacks and Maiden main attacks). Ghoul's normal autos don't have the basic attack flag because pet interactions can be tricky to design interactions around when you don't have a global list of everything like what I've been using to write this post.

* *Found anything else big or notable? I'll add it to the TL:DR.*


That's everything for today. I'm happy I finally got this reported successfully, I thought I'd had to wait for a Tabi's balance change to be planned before I could point it out.

leagueoflegends,"Do the professional league (LCK, LCS, LEC, LPL, &amp; Challenger etc.) observers hear the casters during games?","Just wondering since there've been a countless number of games across all the leagues where casters have been talking about certain champions, vision wards, or specific areas of the map and the observers are doing their own thing that isn't relevent to the conversation at hand.

Just today in the LCS, during the C9 vs EG game, the casters were talking for almost a full minute straight about Fudge's Sion stacks, but the observer was looking elsewhere and the champion focus in the bottom-left was stuck on Elise for like 2 mins. 

Do observers have a lot going on? There seems to be a lack of emphasis when stacking champions/items are in the game, which is information viewers love to see and casters do talk about (Sion stacks, Senna stacks, health stacking items, etc.).

leagueoflegends,Playing while not caring about your elo makes the game much more playable,"Basically this. I dropped G1 from G3 and had a literal breakdown, but soon realized all i need was to find one champion i found fun, mute all and literally play for getting better on that since i love playing that. 

I always try, if i don’t win that’s okay because this is a videogame and no one actually cares what elo you are in, except for insecure toxic people that stalk your opgg. Abusing meta champions can be frustrating if you don’t like them too, so if u find tanks boring don’t play them… you will probably int anyways and will not have fun. I literally went from living League like a nightmare to living League like a game again just by this simple mindset, please do that too. Before this I was super negative and toxic towards the goldish mistakes my team did ( which i probably do too but I didn’t realize ) but now i don’t really care about them, since i wanna just play my champ.

leagueoflegends,Champion Concept (Freljord),"TL:DR; Basically Frozone, adc or supp idk this was a shower thought.. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯


Passive: gains movement speed on ice and ghosting effect. (Maybe affects allies too is its a supp)

Ability 1: Reverse Nocturne Q, you leave a trail of ice where you walk for the duration. (Maybe takedowns reset the duration if its an adc) ice disappears after a delay.


Ability 2: Create frozen patch which applies the sliding effect to enemies. (the closest thing to 'sliding' i can think of is the GROUNDED effect. GROUNDED makes it so that you cant dash but can still input movement, SLIDING would be the opposite, you slide in the direction of your last movement command and cant input a new one but you can still dash.)

Ability 3: passive; every X attack applies brittle. Active; Root all enemies standing on ice.

Ability 4: turn yourself or an ally into ice which slides on ice (a form of stasis, like mini liss ult just no dmg or slow or heal) selfcast; you will continue to slide during q. Ally cast; will follow you (only on ice) 

Idk if 3 or 4 should be the ult. Im thinking 3 because my first thought would be that 4 would only last 2seconds. But idk.


NOTE: Nothing deals dmg idk, would be interesting. All utility. But root could ig. Thats why i thought adc, because it has mobility and peel for itself.


Idk i didnt think this through but my brain just went; ""why arent there any mobility ice champs???"" I suppose this could be a jgler too but for that too happen the passive would need to be changed imo.",ShadowPledge,11/03/23 01:32:31 PM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11obu8t/champion_concept_freljord/

leagueoflegends,What small QoL or cosmetic change would you love for your champion?,"No massive changes. Just small stuff like Malzahar getting a mini-execute on his E to help with last hitting or Jhins Collector execute showing 4444. For me:

\- QoL: Mordekaiser W recasts automatically if the timer runs out. AFAIK it's the only ability in the game with a recast window, that *doesn't* just recast automatically and I don't know why. Imagine Mundo W or Lux E just fizzling, if you don't hit the button again on time. Why? Riot, please!

\- Cosmetic: If Tahm Kench swallows an enemy that would die to the R damage, he just gulps them down and eats them. No spitting needed.

leagueoflegends,new league of legends ranking system by ryuma (critkaisamid),"even if you have 100 kill if your team suck dick you will never climb that's a fact

riot should just do a personal rating mmr instead of the normal mmr

like lets say you lost 10 games in a row but in 10 out of 10 games you had positive kda near perfect cs good vision score then your mmr should increase because that proves you are a good player

so the mmr is based on your stats which are

combat stats

income

map control

all players in a match should have same mmr

you can't play ranked without playing 100 normal games excluding blind pick urf and aram

you can't play a champion without stats in ranked

to have stats on a certain champion you should have at least 4 mastery on him

players should have at least 3 champions with 4 mastery to play ranked

you would ask why

so that people don't get bored from their champion and pick anything else they either pick one of the champions they main or go play normals

idk i'm bored you can add by yourself",critkaisamid,13/03/23 10:03:17 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11pwzkq/new_league_of_legends_ranking_system_by_ryuma/

Not only does she no longer have a mana cost attached to her heal, it's *even easier* to just sit on the ADC or whoever and spam Q to get heals off, and she won't even go OOM doing it this time except she can also grant her team a shield now...

leagueoflegends,My wild little brain thought for Naafiris' kit I think would make her playstyle perfect.,"I have been thinking about this champion a lot. The thought of a pack hunter champion is a really cool idea, but I am very skeptical as to how they are going to pull it off. I've, as such, set my standards a bit low for this champion. But I was thinking, if I could go all out making this kit, what would I do?  
Hey, also, if this is too much reading, just skip to the second to last paragraph for a bit for a little tldr.

&amp;#x200B;

Well, she's a pack hunter, yes, but she's a Darkin first. So we incorporate that in the kit, by having Naafiris' passive make it so your primary abilities don't reset on a timer. Q, W, and E have to be reset by slaying a camp, in the order that they come off cooldown. Maybe it's a quest passive like Kindred where it marks a specific camp you have to get, or maybe it's just any camp. Kind of like a blood sacrifice or however you wanna see it, but this would be used to force her into the jungle.  


Her Q, W, and E are a little special. They've got an Udyr meets Tibbers vibe. On cast, you summon a wolf, depending on the ability used. Their lifetime would increase as you leveled the ability, but let's say base one they last 45 seconds. While they are alive, their ability does not go on cooldown. You can recast it to position the wolf somewhere. Maybe the radius of how far they can be increases as you level as her passive (which would be really silly in urf). When they are recast on a target, they do something else. Q, the red wolf, would dash to the target and slash with a blade. W, the white wolf, would grab on, slow, and reveal the target. Maybe you could even have a subtle drag like the new Asol with this one. And E, the black wolf, would do increased damage to shields and apply grievous. I imagine their hp would start about the size of baby wolves, and by level 5 be at least a little tanky. I don't know how it'd play out (especially with the ult) so maybe they have the hp of like a Zyra plant idk. Using these abilities will also empower your next auto.  


And last, for the ultimate, we're getting stealthy. Her ult would plant down a small, invisible (maybe), box, that would camouflage her and any wolves inside of it. If an enemy comes inside you're revealed, yes, but this would make for the perfect playstyle in my mind. But, this would also have the illaoi effect, of making your wolves invincible when you are revealed, so when you have used your wolves expertly, weaving them in and out of danger, and they're finally low, you make your presents known and tear the enemy apart.   


So, picture this like one of those ability trailers. The blue side mid -- a xerath wearing the new event skin -- is shoving under tower, when suddenly, a black wolf comes rushing at him from red side raptors. He starts moving back away from tower, when a red wolf, flanking him from the direction of his tower. He's forced to flea into the river towards the drake pit. He gets into the pixel bush as !!! BAM a white wolf grabs onto him, hidden in the bush. Naafiri leaps out of camouflage, onto the Xerath, as the black and red wolves dash in for a kill.   


I think this would be perfect for a pack hunter. Not some lane shoving monster tank, but a pack, that need to use each other to succeed. Her playstyle would be less like Yorick or Bel'veth late game where you just shove a tower, and be more like Evelynn, where you use your looming presents to create pressure even if you don't intend on ganking. I know this kit is a wild stretch of the imagination and I'm perfectly content with that. Let me know what you think about this little theory and please be nice :) This is literally only for a bit of fun.",Mistyless,10/03/23 05:26:33 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11n4c4d/my_wild_little_brain_thought_for_naafiris_kit_i/

leagueoflegends,Idea for Yuumi rework,"My idea to balance Yuumi is to make it so that her damage, healing, and shielding scale off AP while her utility scales off lethality.


For example Q the enhanced slow would be changed to Base+lethality scaling. This way if she builds pure ap or support she can only poke and can't enable picks and if she builds lethality she'd be limited by her mana.

Her E would heal normally but the movement speed buff would scale with lethality.

With Ult same thing the damage can scale with AP and if they wanna keep the heal and shield that too. The slow or snare or whatever they do, lethality.

This way Yuumi can be a poke mage with pure AP, a peel enchanter with support, and a pick support with lethality but will be locked out of other parts of her kit so she can't do it all at once. 


Though I don't know what the bases and ratios should be to actually make this work. Obviously bases would need to be somewhat low with decent ratios. But this might make pure AP a problem with high hard to dodge damage with large healing and shielding. Maybe her heal and shield ratios could be low but she benefits double from heal and shield power like a support Yasuo passive. 
Support Yuumi would really only be a heal and shield bot with limited utility.
Lethality can get picks and have decent peel but would be limited by her high mana costs.
Also this would allow any Yuumi build to get Umbral Glaive and actually interact with warding.

I'm not sure how effective this would be or even if it would be a good idea to have a split in builds for a champ that Riot wants to be for newbies.",PlebTier9,12/03/23 05:52:51 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11ow929/idea_for_yuumi_rework/

leagueoflegends,"Whats with all the toxic people who overextend, die and spam ff15?+","This is just happening too much to not be a pattern, every day either in my games, on youtube or twitch, especially junglers who will either try to invade the enemy jungle or push a T2 turret with 0 vision, get caught and killed, say in chat ff15 and start flaming whoever on their team is doing the worst apart from them all calling them a dog or something.

Bonus points when these same players are the ones doing something dumb at lvl 1 and let themselves be caught of and killed, the blame reflection is unreal. 

And another thing that happens is that someone will die 1-2 times in lane and start spamming FF votes and blaming their jg/sup while everyone else on their team is winning but them, or the top laner who keeps trying to ego 1v1 the enemy top and goes 4-14 in lane at 20 minutes. 

Is the protagonist mentality just that horrendous that people refuse to just... Play safe and slowly catch up? You JG can gank a 1-0 Syndra, but a 5-0 Syndra will probably just kill you both or at least one of you easily.",AurielMystic,10/03/23 01:12:56 PM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11nfkm7/whats_with_all_the_toxic_people_who_overextend/

leagueoflegends,The main reason why abyssal mask is bad and how to make it good,"Abyssal mask is an extremely niche item, where if your team has a lot of magic damage(also preferably including the champion you're playing, which is usually the case since most tanks does primarily magic damage) you would want to buy this item to boost your teams magic damage. In theory this item makes a lot of sense, the issue however is if you are so magic heavy that you are considering buying this item to boost your teams damage in team fights, the flat magic pen does very little because the enemy team will probably have at least 1 magic resist item on every champion by the time you finish this item and really start applying the passive in team fights.

Furthermore tanks have worse economy generally since they prioritize sitting in lane farming for items less than other classes to help their team with their cc, making the abyssal mask completion come online later in the game.

Abyssal mask in the games where its meant to be bought(fairly uncommon because so many conditions has to be met for it to be purchased, being a tank buying it, team does probably around 60-70% magic damage, and enemy has magic damage, but not enough so that u need to buy a fon to survive) is that it gets outscaled really quickly.

The only way to make this item in its current iteration worth buying and sacrificing delaying/not buying fon is to make the passive reduce % mr instead of flat, or just make it become more gold efficent, where you would mostly really only buy it for the stats it gives.",Zaparapapa,12/03/23 06:25:42 PM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11pbaiz/the_main_reason_why_abyssal_mask_is_bad_and_how/

leagueoflegends,I kind of like the new LP changes,"I dont really know the exact reason or idea behind the new LP changes but so far it seems like a really good system. I have like many others been in the situation where i would lose way more than i would gain after getting on a pretty good winstreak. These new changes really tests you to see if you belong where you ended up after your winstreak and if you dont, obviously you would see alot more losses. Yea its annoying getting to rank 2 or 1 of whatever division you are in and then going back down because you lose more than you gain, but if you are able to keep a 50% winrate or better you will eventually start to climb again with closer to even or better gains and you would be climbing faster than before.

In my experience, i havent played much ranked the past 3 seasons but i decided to try this season. Ended Silver 1 after placements and quickly made my way through Gold. I got plat and then the higher loss started to hit. I played around 30 games in plat 4 and my mmr is starting to catch up and Im slowly able to climb again and made my way to plat 3. With a steady winrate or better, even though it feels like you are stuck, your mmr will eventually get there. Take it as a test from Riot who is trying to see if you can stay at your newly aquired rank.",Azhp162,11/03/23 02:28:44 PM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11octeb/i_kind_of_like_the_new_lp_changes/

I am currently on the #4 seeded team in NACL (Academy) after the regular season. I went from being a hardstuck random diamond player 3 years ago, to now being able to compete and win against the top players in NACL (Academy) and LCS/Worlds players (I beat 4 SKT players in CQ [SS](https://twitter.com/perryjglol/status/1578291742297665536))*.* To get to this place, I experimented a lot to figure out a way to consistently improve at a rapid rate. This is my current iteration that I have found the most success with.

1. Major Mistakes (Game Losing)
2. General Notes/Summary (TLDR of what happened in game)
3. One Specific Goal/Thing I'm Working on
4. Discipline Mistakes

**Bonus -** Death Reviews for every single death

I put all of these things in a spreadsheet during 2022 Summer CQ over \~144 games. I hope other people will be able to see this and get some value out of looking at my work.

I have also created a new version of my spreadsheets for all of 2023 Spring Soloq/CQ. I will be consistently using this spreadsheet over the next few months.

Please keep in mind that this method will **not work for everyone**. This method is what has worked for me and I am definitely still improving and experimenting with better ways for improvement.

leagueoflegends,Why or why aren't you against furry skins in LoL?,"Faerie Court made it from concept to actual skinline, which is great. It's always nice seeing such a concept from years ago finally reach release.   
This would be third skinline to be made regardless of reception- others being Debonair and Monster Tamers.  


Looking back at the various concepts we saw- the reception of [the concept of Primal skins](https://i.redd.it/d1eru8ce26n81.jpg), was highly negative.  
TL;DR - Primal is supposed to be an AU where champions are anthropomorphic animals.  


Seeing as Faerie Court, part of the same pack of concepts Primal was from- made it as a skinline; I want to know why there's such distain towards the concept. Especially since looking at other skinlines, *it'll most likely be made regardless.*  


Personally, I don't understand how or why it's so hated(?) when skins like Fuzz Fizz have occurred- or when the reverse, like Spirit Blossom Kindred; is loved.   
To double down, a lot of people like Volibear, Warwick or vastayan champions- whom also use a lot of animalistic features (if not sometimes literally just that animal.)  
Other live-service titles have done and capitalized on furry-esque content with little negative feedback.

leagueoflegends,A scenario exists where MAD Lions can get 9th place in LEC Spring Split and still be the #2 LEC representative for MSI 2023.,"First of all this is obviously extremely unlikely, but it's possible.

There are different permutations that allow it by placing different teams in the middle differently. 

Here's an example of such a scenario: **[Image of Scenario](https://i.imgur.com/6AmMB8k.png)**


Again, it's extremely unlikely but possible. Thanks to /u/mrpraedor for mentioning this in a comment. They made me aware of the possibility.

**The more likely scenario is this:**

- MAD/KOI goes to MSI on points if G2 wins again.


In any case, if G2 wins Spring again it's pretty likely that the loser of Spring finals doesn't go to MSI (unless it's MAD or KOI).

Vitality basically has to win in many scenarios to attend MSI.

-------------------------------


In my opinion, the most doomed scenario for EU fans is:

- Vitality loses a close 5 game series to G2 in the final.

- MAD makes it to BO5 stage but fails to win any BO5s.

- KOI doesn't make a deep run.

His own low health is simply a ploy to bait them closer. It rarely works out as intended.

That said, I do try giving him tips on checking the minion wave before engaging, or waiting for the enemy to waste their poke, but all of that vanishes from his mind the instant his Q comes off cooldown.

leagueoflegends,Delete the surrender button,"I play both dota 2 and league of legends. I have thousands of hours in both dota and league and i think both games are great at what they are. But i really think one of the things that dota wins where league loses is the lack of surrender. When there is no surrender button, you have no choice but to keep playing. When that 4-1 ff hits at 15 a vast majority of the time people just keep playing just because what else are they going to do for the 3 minutes until the ff timer hits again (obviously excluding the rare times people just give up and run it mid after that). 

The ff button has ruined peoples mentality competitively. If you arent winning your lane, its FF. someone always wants to fucking give up. I can almost guarantee if surrendering did not exist, players would be significantly better at playing from behind because theyd be thinking about playing from behind rather than “gg fucking ff” every 3 minutes after 15.

League games are short. If ur losing hard, and defeat is going to happen. u were going to probably lose in the next 5 minutes anyway. If you werent going to lose in the next 5 minutes, you can come back.",hardcoregayanalporn,09/03/23 01:05:42 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11m1rya/delete_the_surrender_button/

leagueoflegends,Yuumi's New Best Friend Mechanic Achieves Exactly the Opposite of What It's Supposed to Do,"Riot with Yuumi's rework introduced a new mechanic where sitting on another champion while they kill minions or champions generates friendship points, and whoever you have the highest friendship points on allows you to enhance your abilities while you are attached to them. Ostensibly this mechanic was introduced to make sure Yuumi stays with their ADC, but instead what this mechanic encourages you to do is - as soon as they fall behind - ditch them as soon as possible to go sit on a better performing ally for 10+ minutes to try and achieve a best friend switch as soon as possible. The longer you stick to a poorly performing ADC, the longer this switch takes, and thus the longer your ADC is left with no support at all because you can't risk supporting them at all lest you generate even more friendship with them and make the switch take even longer. Yuumi is not *that* much weaker without best friend active, and will likely be more helpful supporting a fed ally over a poorly performing lane partner even without the best friend enhancements. 

Honestly I felt this problem was pretty obvious when it was on the PBE, I'm kind of shocked it reached live without having friendship totals on allies capped and allowing you to have multiple best friends once you reach a requisite total. This would allow you to hop back to your poorly performing lane partner later in the game when they catch up, and wouldn't force you to completely abandon them just to avoid generating more friendship. Right now if your ADC falls even slightly behind you're taking a risk that they fall further behind and end up making both of you impotent just by sticking around. It's crazy weird to play and it makes me feel horrible when I have to just leave my ADC completely stranded without support for super long so I can swap my best friend to our mid laner (sorry Jinxie... but with Cassiopeia as my best friend we did win the game!).",Obrusnine,08/03/23 09:45:49 PM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11lwsys/yuumis_new_best_friend_mechanic_achieves_exactly/

leagueoflegends,"March Madness: A Primer on Collegiate League of Legends, Part 2: The East Conference, Groups A and B","Welcome back! If this is your first time learning about the collegiate league of legends scene, take a look at my earlier post about the general structure and the North conference, which you can find on my account.

If you already read that or are otherwise familiar, you can jump in right here

For this post, I’m using a different format than yesterday’s focusing more on each group than strong teams or dark horses.

The second conference I’ll be covering is the East Conference, which I am decidedly less familiar with. Under Riot’s conference rankings, the East is third, meaning they receive the same three bids to the college championship as the North. Unlike the North, they were not very successful. Of their 3 bids and 2 select bids, 3 dropped in the ro32, 1 dropped in the ro16, and only **Western University** made the quarterfinals, where they dropped to eventual winners St. Thomas. Based on preseason seeds, the top of the East conference is slightly worse than the North, but the middle of the conference is slightly stronger and the bottom of the conference is significantly stronger, with the North’s lowest team having a D4 average and East’s having a D2 average. The results show the same thing, there are zero teams without at least a game loss, and two of the four groups have no undefeated teams.

# Group A

This is by far the strangest group I’ve examined yet, and 1-seed groups already have polarizing matchups. Of course, **University of Toronto (1)** is one of two remaining undefeated teams in the whole conference. Toronto is historically the best or second-best team in the region, being the national runner-up in 2017 and qualifying for the last two College Championships. They return the jungler and mid from that last team while adding support Snow2, who placed second on team Tony Top at the first NACL qualifier playoffs and first in the second swiss stage, as well as top laner fortunate, who played on University of Toronto Scarborough and similarly made the College Championship.

Toronto’s only game loss comes from **The University of Maryland (8),** which has one of the strangest group stages I’ve witnessed. Though Maryland qualified for the first two College championships where they made the quarterfinals and semifinals, they haven’t been back since 2018. Though they took a game off the top seed and came in as the second seed, they currently sit at 3-3 with losses to **City College of New York (16)** and **University of Pennsylvania (32)**, making this weekend a must-win to keep their playoff hopes alive. If they do manage to sneak in, it’ll be as a low seed that any top seed will be terrified to play in the first round.

The other high seed in danger of missing playoffs is **Stony Brook University (9),** also sitting at 3-3 going into this week. It’s difficult to find this team's history, which usually means they haven’t had success in the past. SBU’s resume looks very similar to Maryland, as they also lost to **University of Pennsylvania (32)** and **University of Toronto** **(1)**, with their last loss coming directly from **Maryland** **(8).**

The two teams benefitting from the middle seed collapse are **City College of New York (16)** and **University of Pennsylvania (32)**, both sitting at 4-2. Like Stony Brook, neither of these teams have any notable players or collegiate history. CCNY looks poised to take the second seed, with losses to only **Binghampton (17)** and **Toronto (1)¸** while UPenn lost to **CCNY (16)** and **Tufts (25).**

Going into the last week, **UPenn (32)** matches up against **Toronto (1)** hoping to lock a top 3 seed in a match that looks almost hopeless, **Stony Brook (9)** tries to keep their playoff hopes alive against **CCNY (16)** while the latter looks to secure a top two spot, and **Maryland (8)** hits bottom team **Brooklyn College (24),** who only has one win on the season.

# Group B

While Group A had a dominant top team and clustered middle, Group B has two very defined halves, with the bottom four teams, consisting of **Syracuse (26), Boston College (31), Carleton University (23),** and **University of Delaware (15)** being a combined 5-19 with their only win over the top four being what appears to be a forfeited game, while the top half is 19-5 with their only loss to the bottom being that same match.

At the very top of the standings by a slim margin is **Western University (7)**, with a 5-1 overall record and only 3 game losses. In addition to being returning conference champions and being the furthest advancing East team at the College Championship last year, Western has qualified for the Championship every year since 2018 with their worst placement being ro16 and best being runner-up to Maryville in 2019. They return three out of five starters from last year’s quarterfinal team. This year, their only loss is at the hands **Boston College (31)**, and given there are no stats available and it was a 2-0 loss, was almost certainly the result of a forfeit due to scheduling. Aside from that, they’ve beat **Université de Montréal (18),** and **Harrisburg University (2),** giving them the best wins in addition to having the fewest game losses.

The other historical powerhouse and the current second-place team is **Harrisburg University (2)¸** who was also the only team to take a game off Western thus far. Harrisburg has almost as much history as Western, qualifying the past two years and making semifinals in 2021. They return four out of five members of last year’s squad and two members of that semifinal squad. This year, in addition to the 1-2 loss to **Western University (7),** they’ve dropped individual games to **Toronto Metropolitan University (10),** and **Carleton (23)**, giving them a 5-1 match score with 4 game losses.

The final 5-1 team is **Toronto Metropolitan University (10)**, whose only match loss comes to the aforementioned **Harrisburg (2).** Toronto Metro has no history in the College Championship or even the East Conference Playoffs from what I can tell, so they’re looking to prove themselves. Toronto Metro has dropped games to **Syracuse (26), Carleton (23),** and **Delaware (15)**, but they’ll have the chance to prove themselves this weekend against **Western (7)**. Regardless, they’ve already qualified for playoffs and will be happy to know they’re only playing for seeding.

The last team in the top half is **Université de Montréal (18)** at 4-2\*\*,\*\* who is playing exactly to their seed line. They haven’t even taken a game off a top seed but only have a single game loss to a team below them, **Syracuse (26).** Like Toronto Metro, this team has never been to a conference playoff, and like the other three top teams, is already locked into their spot. With one final opportunity for a top win against **Harrisburg (2)** this weekend, they could move to a top 2 seed.

This week is an exciting one for this conference. Despite the playoff qualification already being locked, the top four teams heading off against each other will determine very important seeding for playoffs.

# Conclusion

With just two groups down, this post is already nearing the length of the North conference post, so I’m going to cut it into two separate parts. If you read yesterday’s post, be sure to let me know which format you like better and I’ll be back tomorrow with the second half of the East Conference rundown.",Dunglebungus,09/03/23 03:40:43 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11m5w4p/march_madness_a_primer_on_collegiate_league_of/
leagueoflegends,I made a rework for Skarner because I'm a bit bored to wait,"Tiny information before it's a new type of character with 3 forme: a basic one ( whitch is the current skarner ) and 2 oders whitch are a Warden stand and a Juggernaut stand.

The pros is that it alow us to have completely busted spells ( yes it does )

Skarner gains Crystal Fury stacks over time and when he damages enemy champions in a secondary resource bar. At full stacks, Skarner can enter either Crystal Mode or Surge Mode until the end of combat after what Skarner cannot generate Fury for 30 – 0 sec(based on level).

Crystal Mode: Skarner's gains 50 % of his AD as armor and 50 % of his AP as magic resistance.

leagueoflegends,The LCK english casters have really nailed how League should be cast,"When listening to the LCK cast it gives me the feeling of listening to a legitimate sport which League should be at this point. It's like listening to NBA commentary.

The casters don't try to hype every single moment of the game which means when the real hype stuff happens you as a viewer feel more excited. The LEC/LCS casts try so hard to talk hype when nothing worth of hype is happening which drains all the energy for when actual cool stuff is happening.

Also the LCK cast doesn't try to handhold the viewer. They expect you have understanding of the gameplay and not wasting time on basic mechanics it leads to a higher quality cast. Imagine if you watch the NBA and the casters are trying to explain to you what a 3 point shot is. A lot of the time it feels like the LEC is casted with the assumption the viewers have no game understanding.

Listening to T1 vs HLE right now and the cast is just a universe away from what we get in LEC/LCS. Not that I think the on screen talent in the LEC isn't as good, their approach to doing it is just inferior.",Accomplished_Ad_2321,11/03/23 06:18:31 PM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11ogo8h/the_lck_english_casters_have_really_nailed_how/
leagueoflegends,Mages Support back for Midlane,"Its sad that Riot wants to force us a Champ on a only Role last Years.

I think the most Problem is simply the AP scaling.

Sups cant really put their Gold in Rabadons, thats why weaker Mages got forced out of Mid, because there are better options like Orianna, Zoe, Syndra, etc. that can convert better AP.

So give some Mages better AP scaling (not base stat) it wont hurt the balance and it would give Players the choice where he can play is Main more.

Some examples:

\- Morgana (Reducing W Cost over 100 is to much and an Ultimate Cost + buff this scaling (15% is nothing)

\- Zyra (Q, E, and Plants little more AP scaling (as a reminder no base stats, that would be broken)

\- Karma (Q much more AP scaling in comparison to her short range and bad Waveclear)

\- Seraphine (As a Long Range Mage in comparison to others she makes almost no DMG + her Spells are to slow, the AP Scaling should be buffed so that it would be worth to be her Mid back)

\- Lulu (Revert her Q Waveclear Ability and giving her more AP scaling on it)",Samus_Saran,08/03/23 06:29:00 PM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11lsv4p/mages_support_back_for_midlane/

leagueoflegends,How long can it take to buff Aftershock...?,"The keystone rune isn't really taken on any support right now. Even champions such as Leona, Alistar, Rell Nautilus are choosing Glacial Augment.

I think that's a shame. On such champs Afterschock *should* outclass Glacial, but it just isn't right now. The 30% slow you proc and 15% damage reduction on your ally is just better than the extra resistances you receive. I'm not saying Glacial needs a nerf, I'm saying Afterschock needs a buff.

Why not also give the 15% damage reduction on aftershock proc to your allies (and remove the damage part of Aftershock completely if needed)? In this case your only choice is: do I want a slow or more resistances on my tank support?

leagueoflegends,Did you guys notice the eery similarity of Peanut Q'ing out of the Dragon Pit and Riot's rework of Yuumi?,"Life imitates art

You start off doing everything right. You have a vision set up and sufficient budget to power it through. 

You have a plan then you execute it. You have some hiccups along the way, but it's okay, the most important part is your aim is on point (KDF/gamer gf demographic), then you proceed.

You're blind so you won't see that invulnerability is cancer.

But you accomplished to take out the enemy jungler and gained the people's trust...that you know what you're doing. It is now upon you.

The deadline for the dragon death is coming up, it was coming fast and you're amazed at the pace you're taking it down

But you thought to yourself: maybe we would still die if we had Elder

Or we would lose a playerbase if we gutted Yuumi

Then you try to get a little fancy and multitask by introducing more flavors by jumping Ezreal, kicking him in, and buffing the fck out of Yuumi

Then the enemy takes the Elder

And your rework gets meme'd on Reddit

Everybody beats the crap out of your team

And now you're sad.

But that's okay

Sometimes you miss the point, 

But land the combos",SolubilityRules,13/03/23 02:28:43 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11plsum/did_you_guys_notice_the_eery_similarity_of_peanut/

Yet somehow, eve though he is DOWNTRENDING in iron 4, he still got matched up with a silver 2 / bronze 1 duo. The guy was even doing this on purpose as he bought spellthief's edge then cursed us out after the game for no reason. How in the world does matchmaking even create a match like this? This shouldn't even be remotely possible for the matchmaking system to pair that player with anyone other than Iron 4 disasters. I understand placing an iron 2 or iron 3 into an iron/bronze game, or even a bronze 4-3 game.

sure she's forced onto the adc now and offers benefits that have more counterplay than before but unlike before she has absolutely NO incentive to ever get off (except maybe to shield a close ally but even that is usually not worth it) where as before she would at least have to get off to not run out of mana asap, get a shield for her ally or even just to heal herself up.



trading with AAs is as good as impossible now anyway and she literally gets heals and shields even with just afking on her ally. not only is it less fun but it offers even less counterplay than before AND lacks any skill expression at all since a awful yuumi wont be much less useful than a good one",meloneee,09/03/23 04:10:08 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11m6p3j/the_yuumi_is_worse/

leagueoflegends,I made MetaBreaker.gg to bring back variety to League of Legends,"Hey everyone!

  
I recently created a website called MetaBreaker. It's a tool that generates off-meta item builds for every champion in League of Legends.

I was tired of everyone using the same builds every single game, so I made this site to experiment with new items and playstyles. The concept is similar to ultimate bravery and the generated builds should all be possible to play and make sense (most of the time :P).

It is available on the web and mobile. I am planning to create a standalone desktop app in the near future aswell.

I dont think with all the Hard Nerfs that the Ultimate deserve it to changed too, its the only option to real protect our ADC from Danger...because well its an Ultimate its should be Amazing, when its to strong give it more CD, but with theese Changes I can see Yumi wont be played because the ADC feels now 1 vs 2 whole time.",Samus_Saran,08/03/23 06:07:59 PM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11lsi7s/yumi_deleted/

leagueoflegends,BRION's statement for protesting against LCK about issues of the team,"[Statement (in korean)](https://twitter.com/Brionesports/status/1633663969377517568?s=20)

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR in English(it may be misleading because i'm poor at english):

At Feb 5th's issue about [misinforming side selection](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/10u6s6z/brion_reveals_that_they_were_misinformed_about/), LCK has just judged it was a 'operational mistake', ended the case with two judges' 10 games suspension. The case occured also in LCK CL. BRION asked is there any efforts after this to prevent the recurrence.

&amp;#x200B;

BRION states to LCK ""Replenish staffs and train to prevent the mistakes"". After the side selection case, LCK agreed it was the office's fault but shifed responsibility on KeSPA. Also, at LCK's contents, BRION was ignored from the events. ([source](https://www.fmkorea.com/5550403343))

&amp;#x200B;

If LCK ends the case without follow-up measures, BRION will try the best to protect values as a fair sport such as filing a complaint with Fair Trade Commission, civil action and media response.",Oplose,09/03/23 11:45:57 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11mhrqn/brions_statement_for_protesting_against_lck_about/

leagueoflegends,Fun comps for ranked duo,"Hello my guys

Me and my buddy are looking for new ideas for some botlane duos that are fun to play yet completely off the meta. 

We are currently doing Xerath with Ashe support. The idea is not to win but to make the enemy hate the game (or the lane at least)

Some duos we tried and enjoyed were 

Swain/leona; Sivir lethality/rammus; 

Thinking of trying Teemo/Heimer for shroom fortress

Efficiency is of little importance to us.

Give us your best ideas",AdRecent3225,11/03/23 07:56:44 PM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11oid6t/fun_comps_for_ranked_duo/

leagueoflegends,Why am I gaining so much lp?," In previous seasons I was only getting +15 and losing more, but I started this season on a huge loss streak and was placed in bronze 4. Even when I was 0 lp bronze 4, it never deranked me. The second I started winning games, I was getting lp gains like +25-31 and -15 per game and I instantly shot up to silver 4 in like 15 games won from bronze 4.

leagueoflegends,I think there is a middle ground to balance GP and make him less frustrating for both the player AND the opponent.,"TLDR: barrels should scale off of crit strike chance instead of bonus crit effectiveness (think like rengar Q, Ashe passive, navori quickblades) passive should lose its crit damage scaling and gain more movespeed based on critical strike chance. IMO Gangplank should be a hit and run character likes he was in seasons prior AND lose the ability to one shot people at 20% crit (just essence reaver) because it’s ridiculous when it happens.

First off I’m a 1.4 mil GP player that can admit GANGPLANK WAS BONKERS TIER FOR A LONG LONG TIME. The nerfs are justified and I’m not trying to say “GP IS TOO WEAK NOW PLZ BUFF” but the nerfs didn’t change on what the people I play vs HATE and I think there’s a middle ground yet to be achieved.

I’m obviously not some balance guru I simply just know the ins and outs of GP and would love some feedback on how people feel about purposed changes. Maybe I’m on to something, maybe I’m  just a moron OTP that needs his champ s+ tier to climb. 

They target nerfed GPs passive by 60 base damage at level 18, but kept the crit scaling (100% crit = 200 bonus true damage) this is problem #1, full glass cannon GP does not want to go in smacking people, his passive suggests that’s the “gameplan” so they make it hit like a like truck. 

1. Navori should NOT increase its damage, I don’t know why this still works like this, true damage shouldn’t be able to “amped” nor “weakened”
 
2. If riot wants GP to be glass cannon we don’t need more stat stick damage at all, glass cannon GP CANNOT/SHOULD NOT be going blow for blow on bruisers/assassins.

I suggest GP passive gets movespeed per % of critical strike chance, instead of the bonus damage per % crit chance. Glass cannon GP needs to be able to kite and run circles around people, not slap em for 1k true damage because “they got too close”. Gangplank in season 10 use to get 60 ms on slapping a barrel because of triforce, we lost that interaction (most build essence reaver) AND now it scales from 15%-30%. I feel the insane damage stems from the fact that I can’t run away anymore so now I just hold my ground and smack people with my flaming stat stick.

NOTE: if the movespeed is too much, make it only get it’s increased movespeed after slapping a keg NOT just using passive on something. 

My next suggestion is to make barrels DAMAGE scale off % crit chance BUT can no longer crit (Rengar Q, Ashe passive, Navori quickblades)  

NOTE: at 100% crit chance should do about the same amount damage as he does now, I’m suggesting the change so he doesn’t randomly do 1k damage just off essence reaver alone, and makes my damage more linear and NOT random.

Nobody likes getting one shot but phreak explained that bruiser GP cannot be balanced for solo Q and not be 100% pick/ban in competitive play. They need to find a middle ground with Critplank and I think I have a solution. 

If barrels damage scale off % crit chance for its damage, it means Gangplank will get proportionally stronger after every purchase instead of only 20-80% of the time. It sucks for my lane opponents to get 1 shot them level 9 because I rolled the 20%. It sucks for the GP player when the big 3 man barrel does 600 damage instead of 1500 because we didn’t get the 80% chance to crit :(.

I feel a linear scaling will make Gangplank more “predictable” for BOTH sides and just overall less frustrating. 

I’m not going to suggest numbers, I’m biased and will be too generous to my main champion. There are other people more qualified to do that then me. Let me know what y’all think about this? I know people HATE GP I get it, no way to make everyone happy but I THINK we can make everyone less frustrated about the champ.",SageSpliter,12/03/23 11:16:47 PM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11pgy0q/i_think_there_is_a_middle_ground_to_balance_gp/

leagueoflegends,Durability update was a failure,"Last season, champions were given more health, armor, magic resist and scalings to combat the over-increasing damage present in the game. This was a proposed solution to balance out the state of the game filled with the all so prevalent assassins, high base damage on tanks, high damage from mythic items and increasing the longevity of ADCs and Mages survival. While it provided much relief at first, patches later we're right back to square one. 


The patches after the durability update started slowly increasing and tweaking damage values due to a degree of nerfing some champions that were still doing too much damage or just continuously buffing champions over and over (when they weren't a problem in the first place).


Then we're here today. There is still TOO much damage in this game. The countless damage tweaks over the patches basically undid everything the durability update stood for causing it to be a major failure.",ColdBeing,13/03/23 09:17:43 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11pvz4t/durability_update_was_a_failure/

leagueoflegends,Apparently there's a Double Aegis build on K'Sante?,"So apparently Korean soloQ K'Sante's are going Double Aegis? 

Was looking up LoL Wiki to see how this would work.

--- 
Jak'Sho - Aegis (1200) + Kindle (800) + Ruby (400) + 800g = 3200g

*If you go Jak'sho, you get 30 armor, 30 magic resist, 400 health, 20 ability haste.*

---

Double Aegis - 1200 + 1200

You have 800g extra to spend it on either Ninja Tabi because of the Free Boots Rune OR 2 Ruby Crystals.

Double Ruby Crystals sound like a good option because Jak'Sho Recipe is Kindle + Ruby. So you're already building into it.

Kindle only gives 200 health. Double Ruby Crystals give 300 health. 

*If you go the Double Aegis Build with 2 Ruby Crystals, that's 60 armor, 60 magic resist, 300 health, 20 ability haste*

leagueoflegends,"With Moonstone Ezreal being played by Showmaker, Ezreal is now able to use an item from every main class in a meta build.","It's appropriate that Ezreal's weapon is a Gauntlet because he just collected all the Infinity Stones.

Showmaker is currently playing [Moonstone Ezreal](https://www.op.gg/summoners/kr/DWG%20KIA). [As explained better by LS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbHCy2vEI1U&amp;ab_channel=LSHighlights%26Clips), the idea is that you can play a more supportive Mid Ezreal with Conqueror and Bloodline; it's a standard Ezreal build but the mythic is simply replaced with Moonstone. Since Ezreal makes use of AP, AD, and AD heavily and since his usual items contain A LOT of Ability Haste, Ezreal can consistently prock Moonstone, providing both long-range poke, increased self-healing from Conqueror, and of course, healing for your entire team in teamfights all from range. Showmaker has even complemented this build with Oblivion Orb!

\------

I find this hilarious because with this addition to Ezreal's arsenal, his itemization not only now includes an item from every class, but they are also all **competitively viable** and even **meta:**

* **Marksman/Crit User:** Kraken Slayer, Essence Reaver, Navori Quickblades, Manamune, Guardian Angel
* **Fighter:** Trinity Force, Divine Sunderer, Ravenous Hydra, Maw of Malmortius, Blade of The Ruined King
* **Assassin:** Duskblade of Draktharr, Serylda's Grudge
* **Tank:** Frozen Heart, Iceborn Gauntlet
* **Mage:** Oblivion Orb, Crown of the Shattered Queen, Zhonya's Hourglass, Luden's Tempest
* **Support/Enchanter**: Moonstone

And these include a **Tear** item and a **Tiamat** item!

leagueoflegends,"The Yuumi rework was a step in the right direction, but Riot left the two most problematic parts of her kit completely intact","In my opinion, the two things that make Yuumi the most frustrating to play against are (1) she's an enchanter that can't be targeted and focused down, and (2) her ability to give movespeed to the champion she's attached to results in a lot of very unhealthy interactions. The first thing is obviously never going away because I seriously doubt Riot is ever going to admit that an enchanter that can't be targeted is inherently unhealthy (even though it clearly is), so I'm chalking that up as just whatever. The movespeed, however, is something that they could have changed. Imo she should only be able to give movespeed to her best friend. One of, if not the worst thing, about Yuumi is her sitting on an immobile champ like Aatrox, Udyr, Illaoi, etc and just spamming E movespeed, essentially removing their primary weakness of being kited. Making your team's bruiser unkitable is extremely unhealthy. 

The rework did do a lot of things right. Gating some of her buffs behind the best friend mechanic was a step in the right direction. Adding a bit of skill expression in her Q is also great. And my favorite change is that her ult no longer snares, that was a huge step in the right direction.

leagueoflegends,Champion Shard Suggestion - ARAM Odds Boost,"I had an idea for what Riot could implement with Champion shards/permanents that might make it feel less bad for those of us who have all champions unlocked. Instead of breaking them down in Blue Essence, which you probably already have 20K+ of at this point, there should be a way to spend them in ARAM that increases the likelihood of getting a champion, but doesn't necessarily guarantee it. 

So say I own all champions and I have 1 Vayne shard. I would select the Vayne shard from my Loot and assign it to ""ARAM Odds Boost"". Then, whenever I queue up for ARAM, instead of a 1 in 162 chance of getting Vayne, I would instead have a 1 in 50(?) chance. The exact value doesn't have to be that, but something along those lines that allows you to get that champ slightly more often. You could also maybe have 3-5 slots that you could fill with shards that each give the same boost. So if you are a engage support player, you could use Braum/Thresh/Leona etc. 

Once you do get your champ through being assigned it (trading for it doesn't count), it consumes the shard. This prevents people from being able to perma get champions that make ARAM unfun for others while also discouraging disenchanting for Blue Essence. The exact numbers could be tweaked and adjusted, but its an idea that might make ARAM's a bit more enjoyable and Champion Capsules/Leveling up after 150 not feel useless.",OpTicDyno,09/03/23 12:17:12 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11m0hb3/champion_shard_suggestion_aram_odds_boost/

leagueoflegends,Honor 5 Token Shop should have event-exclusive chromas,"Others have already reiterated the point that the Honor 5 Token Shop is underwhelming to say the least (*we know Grey Warwick and Medieval Twitch chromas ain’t it*), but I haven’t seen many suggestions on what the tokens could be redeemed for instead. **My suggestion is that the Honor 5 Token Shop offer event-exclusive chromas.**

Reasoning:

1. **Event-exclusive chromas remain a cool flex for a champ/skin you like**: It would mean to earn the chroma you had to have either a) grinded an event’s tokens to get it at that time or b) were honored consistently enough over the course of a season and picked it as your reward. From Riot's standpoint, both options seem good for player engagement.
2. **You're somewhat incentivized to spend money on skins**: Unless you happened to get the skin from a chest/already had it, YOU STILL NEED TO BUY THE SKIN TO USE THE CHROMA. Speaking for myself, I would be more incentivized to buy RP to get a skin if I felt that the chroma was an “exclusive” reward.

Would love to hear others' thoughts/suggestions/pushback!

leagueoflegends,"Clash still has the problem of losing the first game and having your next opponent forfeit, but I have the perfect solution !","Mathematically, half of clash teams lose their first game, but (I feel like) most loser bracket never happen because of a high dropout rate.

To summary, the  winner bracket is lot of fun, the loser bracket is usually an unfun waiting room.

Lots of solution has been suggested, but here is mine :

* Remove loser bracket
* Teams who lose can retry and look for another bracket if it's still in the allowed time frame.
* A team who won a bracket can not retry and has to stop for the day.
* The clash reward is based on your best performance of the day.

&amp;#x200B;

Why is this the best solution for players :

* No more forfeit. As only the winner bracket remain, every team has the incentive to play and win. Unless something happen IRL for one of the player, forfeit should not happen anymore.
* No more waiting time after a loss. You lost your first game ? No problem, you can retry a new bracket with close to no waiting time.
* Groups of friend that booked their evening to play clash together will be able to play many games, even if they lose every single one of them.
* More teams will look for a bracket, meaning less waiting time in the matchmaking
* As smurfers will get to play only once per account (as they probably will stomp and win), the average number of smurf teams per bracket will decrease.  


&amp;#x200B;

Why is this the best solution for Riot games :

* No amount of reward will completely fix loser bracket, because a part of players play to win and be #1, and another has bad mental and ragequit after first loss. Both case are solved if we remove loser bracket.
* The amount of clash games played will increase.
* Players still get the possibility to be #1 even if they lose their first game.
* It does require very little work to be implemented.

&amp;#x200B;

To be honest, I see only one downside : I'm not sure that EUW server will be able to handle the overall increase in clash games.

As a support player its feel really good when you see your carry make full use of it and accomplished crazy plays cause you allowed them to push past the their limits.  


EDIT: I think this on me not really explain my question well enough. Its not that offensive buffs don't exist on support, they usually come with atleast one. Its more so that being an offensive buffer never seems to be the focus or core of the champion. The focus is usually leans more towards heal/shield or CC. Look at the ways people rank up skills, you almost always max out the heal/shield ability. If the heal/shield comes with a offensive buff like Eye of the storm, thats great, but that's not really why you pick it.

leagueoflegends,"In the last few patches, Swain has dropped to the worst pickrate he's ever been in midlane. My take on what his satisfaction / fantasy issues are and how they could be solved","Fun fact:

Swain as of 13.4-13.5 is the 3rd LOWEST PICKRATE midlaner champion

2nd: Corki

1st: Neeko (she's getting a midscope...)

Swain mid has lower pickrate than:

**Galio**, **Gragas** (Mid), **Rumble** (mid), **Diana**(Mid), **Xerath**, **Taliyah, Ryze, AZIR, TWISTED FATE**

Just think about that...

I'm   one of the most vocal players about Swain's issues and I don't think   he's THAT level of bad to play and it's sad to see my OTP in this state.

In my opinion, for Swain to be satisfying (and in line with his fantasy, tbh), he needs:

\-Better scaling

\-Rylais to become an optional item

Personally  after months of thought and countless rework ideas I think the  adjustment that fixes these 2 problems in the best and easiest way  possible is (re)introducing Toggle R (with a 25/20/15 sec cooldown). I  strongly believe it solves these 2 core problems, while also increasing  Swain's satisfaction, scaling and enhances his fantasy. If you want to  read it, this is my post explaining it in detail:

(NOTE:   If riot comes up with a different set of adjustments to fix the 2 core   problems I mention, I am totally okay with that. I 'm not obsessed  with  Toggle R. Hell, I didn't even start playing Swain before his   rework (when he had Toggle R), I just think Toggle R would solve these  problems.)

[https://www.reddit.com/r/SwainMains/comments/10nus28/swains\_scaling\_is\_so\_bad\_i\_am\_sick\_of\_it/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SwainMains/comments/10nus28/swains_scaling_is_so_bad_i_am_sick_of_it/)

This  solution is also not as big (budget-wise) as a mid scope, it's just a R  rework and number adjustments, so I'd appreciate if Riot would check  the post and evaluate accordingly.

Also    Fishlord's (#1 Swain OTP in the world in Challenger) version of  Toggle R rework, you   can find his post here (which he posted just  yesterday). I find his solution just as good or perhaps  even  better:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/SwainMains/comments/11neix9/my\_swain\_changes\_that\_would\_help\_increase\_solo/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SwainMains/comments/11neix9/my_swain_changes_that_would_help_increase_solo/)

To    clarify: I believe the mid scope did enhance his fantasy because of   the  infinite R. The 12 sec timer on previous R with the explosion in   the  end is mainly what turned him in a burst mage.

However,    his insane synergy with Liandrys &amp; Rylais restricts the  champion's   late game battlemage fantasy while also making him a  utility mage  which **IS NOT WHAT PLAYERS WANT ( I hope we don't need to reach 0.5% pick rate to understand that)**

THAT is where the mid scope failed

To   clarify #2: I AM NOT saying Swain's weak. He's pretty okay right now   but he feels unsatisfying for his OTPs and after the mid scope he turned   into a utility, bad scaling mage which is NOT what players want",Manos132,10/03/23 09:16:28 PM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11noy31/in_the_last_few_patches_swain_has_dropped_to_the/
leagueoflegends,Darius was among the highest searched-for champion to learn how to counter. Here are 5 counter champs,"[Darius](https://app.mobalytics.gg/lol/champions/darius/build) can be one of the most lane-dominant Top laners in League of Legends. Picking the wrong champion versus him can leave you with little to do apart from play safe or die over and over again.

They are:

* [Yorick](https://app.mobalytics.gg/lol/champions/yorick/build)\- 55.2%
* [Dr Mundo](https://app.mobalytics.gg/lol/champions/drmundo/build)\- 53.9%
* [Gangplank](https://app.mobalytics.gg/lol/champions/gangplank/build)\- 53%
* [Teemo](https://app.mobalytics.gg/lol/champions/teemo/build)\- 52.8%
* [Wukong](https://app.mobalytics.gg/lol/champions/monkeyking/build)\- 52.5%

Because of how hard he can be to play against, its obvious why Darius counters are one of the most searched for counter picks in LoL. Here’s an infographic on 5 of the best champions to pick against Darius in the Top lane.

https://preview.redd.it/x0g2pyto2kma1.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=e0eeaa7bbbfaab2bca6b1c7381b6a25a57795b95

As a bonus, here are some tips and tricks from some of our one-trick community members to play as each of these champions against Darius.

**Yorick vs Darius**

* Try to poke Darius in the lane before you engage on him as he has the advantage in long trades but struggles in short engagements.
* Avoid taking long trades with Darius during the early game as once his Passive hits 5 stacks he will gain a large amount of attack damage and will be able to easily kill you.
* Avoid standing on the outer edge of Darius when he uses his as it will deal damage, apply 1 stack of his Passive and also heal him for a percentage of his missing health.
* If Darius misses his E in lane you will have a large window of time while it is on cooldown to trade with Darius as he will have no way to close the distance between the two of you.

**Dr Mundo vs Darius**

* You always need to be above half health once Darius has his Ultimate, otherwise, Darius can easily kill you even while you are under the effects of your Ultimate.
* Never take longer trades against Darius, especially if he didn't use his E to engage the fight. Once his Passive grants him extra damage, he will almost certainly turn the fight around quickly. Should you try to run away, he'll pull you back with his E.
* Darius will kill minions extremely quickly with his Q if he uses it in the minion, causing the wave to push to your tower. You want this, as this helps prevent Darius from freezing by his tower and forcing you to use your Q to grab minions.
* Your goal early on is to abuse and poke him down with your Q and then look for all-ins with your Jungler or when he very low. Don’t under estimate Mundo’s damage output and poke with his Q.

G**angplank vs Darius**

* If Darius somehow is able to land his E on you and pull you in, do not use your W immediately. Use it once Darius has used his W so you can remove the slow and potentially escape.
* Before looking for an all in, make sure Darius is below 50% health by poking him down with your Q. If he is above 50% health, don’t bother aggressively trading.
* When fightin Darius, try to avoid long trades with him as he will come out ahead thanks to his Passive. Keep trades nice and short, preferably where you’re able to stay outside of his E range.
* Always keep mental distance between you and Darius. If you’re close to him, he will be able to pull you in with his E. Try to stay out of range of this ability at all times.

**Teemo vs Darius**

* Keep the minion wave closer to your side of the map. As you're not the strongest early on, keeping the wave her provides you with a ton of protection against ganks, enemy all ins and it also prevents the enemy from zoning you away from the minion wave.
* Remember, you're not very strong early on and need time to scale. Focus on farming while using Teemo's range to bully Darius.
* Stand at your max range whenever trading to reduce his ability to trade back. If you stand close to him, he's going to be in range of pulling you in with his E, which will result in your death.
* When the enemy moves forward to last hit, use your superior range to harass them with basic attacks. Do not over commit to trading though, but an auto attack here and there could provide great results later on.

**Wukong vs Darius**

* Keep the minion wave close to your side of the lane.You can then all-in him over and over again when he walks forward to pick up farm
* Be prepared to sacrifice CS for XP and health against Darius. Only last hit minions what you can withut losing health. It's not worth over extending, over greeding for a couple minions when he can just pull you in with E and start a fight.
* Do not go for extended trades with Darius period. He is incredibly strong thanks to his Passive which makes 1v1 duels extremely difficult for you. Keep trades short and sweet when neccessary.
* Hit level 2 and 3 at the same time as Darius. He has a very strong all in at these levels and if you're under-leveled compared to him- he might look for the fight. Hit level 2 (the first 7 minions) at the same time so you can even out the fight when you fight each other.

Innate: Mana Core Converter
- Kartana has 0 base Mana Regeneration and 100% of her bonus Mana Regeneration is converted to Maximum Mana instead (4 Max Mana per 1% Mana Regen.
- Kartana’s abilities against enemy champions and her abilities that kill enemy minions or monsters have a chance to drop Mana Crystals. Kartana can collect Mana Crystals using her abilities to permanently increase her Maximum Mana by 5.

Passive: Mana Core Generator
- Kartana’s Mana-Scythe contains her Mana Core Generator, allowing her basic attacks against enemy champions to generate 10/15/20/25% missing Mana on-hit and dealing 1/2/3/4% Max Mana bonus magic damage on-hit.

Q: Mana Scythe (100 + 15% Max Mana)
Active: Kartana twirls dealing 50/75/100/125/150 (+60% AP + 1% AP per 100 Maximum Mana) (+2/3/4/5/6% Maximum Mana) magic damage to all enemies in a large circle around her. Enemies hit in the Sweet-Spot of the circle by Kartana’s Mana Core are dealt 50% increased damage and are mana-reaved for 20/40/60/80/100%. 
Mana-reave: Champions who are Mana-reaved are forced to expend more Mana the next time they use an ability.

W: Mana-Reap (100 + 25% Current Mana)
Passive: When a Champion Mana-reaved by Kartana uses their Mana-reaved ability, Kartana gains a shield equal to 50/60/70/80/90/100% of its mana cost for 2 seconds. This can stack.
Active: Kartana throws her Mana-Scythe at a location becoming unable to basic attack while she is not holding her Mana-Scythe.
Recast: Kartana’s Mana-Scythe quickly returns to her executing all enemies it passes through if they are under a threshold. (4/5/6/7/8% Max Health + 1% per 1000 bonus Mana) Enemies passed through by the Mana-Scythe that are not executed are slowed by 50% for 1 second.

E: Mana Shift (50 Mana + 15% Maximum Mana)
Active: Kartana dashes a short distance in a direction or a large distance towards a target, dealing 50/70/90/110/130 (+50% AP + 1% AP per 100 Maximum Mana) magic damage where she lands. 
If the Target is a Mana Crystal this ability’s cooldown is refreshed but costs double the Mana cost if activated within 4 seconds. This effect refreshes on subsequent casts and can stack up to 2 times.

R: Mana Core Corruption (100 Mana)
Active: Kartana’s Mana-Core enters Corruption for 8 seconds. 
Corruption: Kartana continuously 10/15/20% Mana-Reaves herself and the effects of Mana Core Generator is increased by 50%/75/100%. 
Mana Crystals are more likely to fall while Kartana is Corrupt, and collecting Mana Crystals extends the duration of Corruption by 1 second.

If that was the plan, then well played. The only champion which was giving me fun from this game is currently unplayable. If that's making him more playable outside pro play, than I don't want to know how possible nerf would look like.

leagueoflegends,[SATIRE] Skarner VGU Abilities Reveal,"At long last, we've finally been given a glimpse into Skarner's VGU abilities from recent PBE leaks! He looks like he's going to be a lot of fun to play with a very interactive gameplay experience. Yes, they're keeping the spires :)

&amp;#x200B;

### PASSIVE - Crystal Spires

Summoner's Rift randomly spawns Spires every 30 seconds near his own team's jungle camps. Standing on a Spire for 5 seconds grants vision around the area, grants Skarner with a permanent 10 Ability Haste, and modifies his other abilities.

&amp;#x200B;

### Q - Crystal Slash

Skarner lashes out with his claws, dealing physical damage to all nearby enemies. After collecting 5 Spires, this becomes a toggle, causing Skarner to repeatedly slash at a rate that scales directly with ability haste (uncapped).

&amp;#x200B;

Every (20 - 10, scaling with level) slash becomes Crystal Pound, which has a radius of 50 additional units per Crystal Pound cast during the game. The radius increase may scale infinitely.

&amp;#x200B;

### W -  Crystalline Exoskeleton

Skarner gains a shield (scaling with max %HP) and has increased Move Speed while the shield persists. Every 3 Spires collected permanently increases the HP scaling on the shield (uncapped).

&amp;#x200B;

### E -  Fracture

Skarner summons a blast of crystalline energy which deals damage to enemies struck and slows them. Basic attacking these enemies within a  short window will stun them.  Each Spire collected grants the slow an additional 5% effectiveness and the stun an additional 0.25 seconds duration.

&amp;#x200B;

### R - Impale

Skarner suppresses an enemy champion and deals damage to it. During this  time, Skarner can move freely and will drag his helpless victim around  with him. Champion takedowns or collecting a Spire immediately refresh the cooldown of this ability.

&amp;#x200B;

Ofc theres supposed to be an autofill in enemy right? Happens like 40% of the time.

leagueoflegends,What is that Yuumi rework?,"I just read the patch notes, after a quick blurb about making her less frustrating they decide to add ap on-hit damage to her q, passive healing when hitting abilities, just straight-up healing on her passive, AND healing on her ult. As if the only frustrating thing was her being able to attach herself to Garen and now that that's ""solved"" she needs to be more effective. Does it matter if it's a 6/3 Garen or a 10/0 Vayne that's turbo arrowing your ass? The most baffling change is the best friend thing, the blurb reads like the intention was to nerf her when she's not on her best friend, but she's just as strong as ever, she just gets a free Syndra passive on her abilities when she chooses.",Solid-Platypus4447,10/03/23 04:53:44 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11n3gkl/what_is_that_yuumi_rework/
leagueoflegends,"I hate the fact that soloq rank ""corresponds"" to your skill level","TL:DR at the end

Yeah I know, I know. Statistically speaking the more games you play the more accurate your rank is but at what cost?

There are million things that Riot could do better about the ranking system. Community consensus is that the soloq rank is your main rank. No one cares about flex rank, clash trophies, normal games etc. The only thing that defines you as a League of Legends player is soloq rank and the worst thing is that it doesn't really tell you much about the actual skill level.

People often distinguish soloq and pro scene as two different games but in reality they are literally the same. The only difference between those two is that thanks to perfect team communication pro players can make objectively speaking the best possible decisions both micro and macro at any given moment. In soloq there are the same best decisions but due to the lack of communication and other factors (like having trolls etc.) this decisions are impossible to implement hence there is like a hierarchy of decisions depending on what your teammates agree on, their personal experiences, their motivation and so on.

It's very frustrating for the players that are aware of all of the best decisions after watching yt videos or pro matches to play soloq and see how unaware of them are their teammates. If you want to be a good soloq player you have to identify which of the best decision is in fact the best taking into account all other random factors that you may or may not expect from strangers.

BUT if that was the only skill that I should have to reach rank 1 I would be more than happy. Unfortunately there are many more factors that are responsible for your match result. Being good at game is paradoxically not enough. You have to endure rivers of toxicity towards you and not care about it even for a second. You have to resolve confilcits inside your team acting as a kindergarten teacher. You have to not care about the fact that you lost game only because someoen refused to play because of a main character syndrome or simply because he wanted others to not have a privelage to win. You have to play perfectly without any major mistakes every single game and then maybe, just maybe you will be able to climb ranks and reach 70% wr because still you'll lose 30% of the games no matter whether you stayed afk from the first minute or played like Faker all the game.

It is mentally draining to play soloq and I hate having games like [this](https://www.op.gg/summoners/eune/Macashi/matches/izN3rnOMSFHI8UKB8kH5HzWTpBm7qiFrPouGYf0DR1Q%3D/1678556234000). I literally had a main charachter syndrome rage quitter at 16th minute and troll that after his two stupid decisions decided to sell all items and buy and place pink wards at the fountain until he lost all the money and all of this in a 28 minutes game (for which I believe we didn't even get LP loss mitigation). If you don't believe you can change the replay for yourself or I can send you one. How am I supposed to queue up after this kind of game and say ""it's okay, nothing happened let's win the next one""?

I peaked D1 last season and I'm having troubles to maintain in diamond in the current season. I know what is different: I'm not as mentally resistant to all the things mentioned above. I don't think that it should work like this. Or maybe I'm completely wrong and someone will be polite enough to critisize me and point out what are the areas I can improve in. I would always describe loss streaks as losers queue that one can fall in randomly but this season after behavioral system changes I noticed something different. Every time I lose some games in a row I endure more toxic behaviours from the start of even the champ selects. Moreover I get tons of instant feedback report notifications. Don't get me wrong, it's cool and all, but the chat restriction is not really making a difference for an inter. I feel like the true losers queue is just a toxic queue where people for no reason flame themselves from the very beggining which results in higher lose rates.

I'm not saying that Riot is not doing anything. I like the fact that they are slowly going back to the ELO system by removing the series between divisions, reducing number of divisions from 5 to 4, making a bo5 series between leageus a bo3 and increasing LP gains. I believe that the next step would be to get rid of divisions and finally making MMR visible. But I expect even more like making a better after the game performance evaluation of the player and tying the LP gains/losses on the individual performance like 1 or 2 points more gained after being the MVP or something. It would do good for the system and the fight against toxicity as well.

I invite all of you to share your thoughts about my reflections and I will be happy to discuss those matters with you in the comments!

TL:DR

I'm extremely frustrated that playing soloq drains me mentally and I think that the ranking system needs a rework. Mainly changing the fact that soloq rank defines your skill level. Grinding soloq requires not only individual skill both micro and macro but also resolving team confilcts, giving compliments, not tilting after you get afk or troll in a team, not making a single bad decision every game because you never know which 400 games out of 1000 really depend on you. I feel like those reamining 600 games are a complete and frustrating waste of ones time.",Macashi,12/03/23 02:56:29 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11orx9b/i_hate_the_fact_that_soloq_rank_corresponds_to/
leagueoflegends,2023 CLASH scouting: Now supporting former Garena regions,"I work on the site [**Clash.Tips**](https://Clash.Tips) that helps you keep track of your past performances so you know what to pick, and scout opponents so you know what to ban. I've made lots of updates in the past year that hopefully give everyone a better experience in Clash.

If you're a SEA player you won't have any Clash games yet, but after your first match you can look at your opponent and try to get some useful info from it like:

* What did they pick
* What did the enemy ban against them (crowdsource your scouting)
* Which lanes won (looking at turret plates and CSD per lane)

# Main Features

**Clash Schedule**:

See upcoming Clashes on the home page

**Playstyle Overview**:

When looking to pick up teammates for your clash team, you can look at a quick overview of some key stats in their past Clash games. These help show the player's playstyle and can help you decide if they match what your team needs (found under the Review page)

[**Team Planner**](https://clash.tips/planner)**:**

Currently in progress, this tool will help you and your team decide beforehand what options you have in draft and potential bans. I'm still pretty early on in creating this so feedback is much appreciated. Press edit, then type in a player's name to import their past clash champions, then select roles and rearrange champs as you see fit. ([clash.tips/planner](https://clash.tips/planner))

Thanks for reading all the way through the post, I hope this can help your clash be more fun with better prepared drafts! [**Clash.Tips**](https://Clash.Tips)

&amp;#x200B;

**Closing question for everyone**:

*What do you think is a better system for your team in clash?*

1. Everyone picks 1 role and sticks with it for all 3 games  
*Pros: lets you have consistent/simple drafts and the same style for the night*
2. Everyone picks several roles and they flex between them depending on what the enemy picks/bans  
*Pros: More potential champions in each lane let you have more counters and be harder to ban out*",shedinja292,09/03/23 12:34:22 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11m0xkk/2023_clash_scouting_now_supporting_former_garena/

leagueoflegends,If AZIR dealt physical damage instead of magic damage it would be much less used in competitive.," Riot is trying to increase the champion's winrate in solo Q and remove him from the competitive, if azir had a passive similar to corki's that transforms AP into physical damage, azir would no longer be a problem in pro since there would be a lack of magic damage in the composition of the team. Azir would still build the same ap items, and will still have the same mechanics but all his magic damage will be converted to physical damage.

 This would be effective because in pro play there is a need to have mages in mid, using an physical damage champion in mid would make either the toplaner or the bot to take AP champions which would make most of the compositions not viable.

 This change would not make any difference in solo Q because there is no such thing as a requirement for mages in mid",LULALIVRECADEIA,10/03/23 06:32:47 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11n64jj/if_azir_dealt_physical_damage_instead_of_magic/
leagueoflegends,Main Change That Yuumi Needs,"As someone that has played over 100 Yuumi games and played against her the same amount, theres 1 clear change that NEEDS to happen. 

Yuumi's W NEEEEEEDS to go on a full cooldown if her host dies while she's attached. Easily the strongest part of her kit is that there's ZERO punishment for letting her host die. 

In teamfights/skirmishes, a team should be rewarded for nuking her host, or punishing Yuumi for not swapping fast enough. This would allow her to be hard focused and not be allowed to let 4 straight hosts die and still be able to seamlessly jump to a new one.",greendino71,13/03/23 02:09:54 PM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11q1tme/main_change_that_yuumi_needs/

leagueoflegends,"Which male champion would, hypothetically, look the cutest in a skirt?","Title.

It has to be Ezreal right? I mean, he isn't like, super ripped, and he probably shaves his legs and stuff. And he is also all cheerful and whatnot, Idk, I think it has to be him.

Alternatively, it could be Viego, for a more gothic emo look? Kinda like Wednesday but with a 6-pack? I don't know. But he sounds kinda depressed.

Or perhaps it'd be someone like Kayn. Again, a lot more edgy than Ezreal, but he has long hair and he sounds like a anime enthusiast 4chan shitposter, which I find amusing.

Lastly, could also be someone like Aphelios, but he is an edgy quiet guy that hears voices and has a rifle, so I don't know about that.",Final_Foot_Fucker,08/03/23 12:49:40 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11l4fo9/which_male_champion_would_hypothetically_look_the/
leagueoflegends,Skinline Idea: Elemental Cataclysm,"Deep in the Desert of Shurima, a shard of a World Rune is discovered by a Noxian Expeditionary Force. It doesn't take long before the News reaches the Sun Disc and the Emperor Azir. Determined to retrieve the shard and use it to reforge Shurima in his image he slaughters the convoy transporting it and in the heat of battle the Shard unleashes its power causing a massive explosion of wild magic that leaves a crater on the Northern coast of Southern Continent, devastating the Colonies of Noxus.

That wild magic shakes Valoran to its core and corrupts and reforms the magic from Targon to Ionia. Today, two years Later, various Mages affected by the event travel the world to find a way to reverse the effect while Ryze is still reeling from the shockwave. Meanwhile the Emperor of Shurima uses his new element to wreak havoc on the Noxian Colonies. In the chaos, an unlikely bond is formed between Annie and Vladimir who crossed paths in the forests of Noxus. Can Ryze prevent the chaos from Spreading? Will Azir burn down the Noxian Empire?

&gt;Hey internet. Thanks for all the support over the past few months while I was afk

&gt;I am back now with some big news to share: I have decided to step down from my role at Riot Games

&gt;A combo of personal and professional considerations led me to down this path. We experienced some devastating personal losses last year and I want to be closer to my surviving family.

&gt;But while I was on break I got to think a lot about my career. Grief has a way of really bringing into focus what matters the most to you (still don’t recommend it overall though). And after nine years at Riot it feels like it’s time for something new!

&gt;I said from the beginning that building a League of Legends MMO worthy of you all was going to be a long journey. The most important job I could do as part of that was to build an amazing team, and while I try to stay humble overall, I will brag about this team all day!

&gt;The MMO is in good hands and it’s the right time to hand over the reigns for the next phase

&gt;I plan to stay in game development and I have had a number of exciting opportunities presented to me already. And I will be with you all playing the Riot MMO when it comes out. 

&gt;Hugs, GC

Tryndamere [tweeted](https://twitter.com/MarcMerrill/status/1633235794679959552) this on the MMO's development:

&gt;A little bit ago, @Ghostcrawler shared that after 9 years with @riotgames he’ll be stepping away to focus on the things that matter most: his family. Thank you again for everything, Greg.

&gt;I want to take a second to talk a little about what that means for the MMO… 

&gt;First, we are still in early development, but have a direction that we’re very excited about. We’re working hard to deliver an experience that you’ll love. (But it will still be a VERY long road to get there - thanks for being patient with us.)

&gt;We believe in this game and the team working on it. If we look at development as a race, Greg has run an amazing first leg with an incredible team, and I know whoever takes the baton next will be set up for success going forward. 

&gt;In the meantime, we’re looking for the world’s best and brightest who LOVE MMOs.  If you have ever dreamed of helping to build what we hope can be the world’s next incredible MMO - we’d love to hear from you.",Spideraxe30,08/03/23 06:38:40 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11ldvmj/ghostcrawler_executive_producer_for_the_mmo_and/

leagueoflegends,Skin ideas for every champ - L,"Hello everyone!

Let's see L.

**LeBlanc**

*Pharaoh*: She could easily look good with this skin, kinda like Nida, maybe I'd give that bigger striped headpiece to her. Her iconic makeup and her staff would both work.

*Blood Moon*: Something like Sivir, a half mask to represent her illusionist nature, her sigils could be blood moon symbols.

*Soulstealer*: Similar to Vayne, just don't make it too much like her Ravenborn skin.

*Goth*: She already has lots of goth elements in her skins, with her makeup, hair sometimes etc.

*Dreadnova*: She'd be the leader of this intergalactic empire, idk space Noxus I could imagine. Maybe not the leader but whatever.

**Lee Sin**

*Dark Star*: Normally this wouldn't bee the first skin I'd think of for Lee, but DS usually doesn't give eyes to it's champs so I thought that might be something good for lee. His Q could be a black hole.

*Ruined*: He's a positive character so he could be ruined and I think he'd be an interesting one too see how his version would look like.

*Three Honors*: The fashion of Malza would fit Lee well too.

**Leona**

*Broken Covenant*: Some nice silver armor, stained glass in her sword and shield.

*Riot*: Collapsible baton for sword, police shield, pefect combo I think.

*Dawnsword*: A DnD/Rift Quest style skin, heavy armor paladin looks.

*Battle Queen*: Fitting skin and Dia also has this skin, why not give it to her too.

*Cafe Cuties*: Mostly the skirt isnpired this, but I still think she could fit into this well. Female supports in general would mostly be good with this skin line.

**Lillia**

*Cottontail*: Bunny costume, she already has the little tail, big ears for it, and she is meant to be a cute character so this works for her. E rolls an easter egg.

*Porcelain*: Just generally a good match.

*Old God*: Kinda like Ivern this ancient forest spirit, for a more serious skin.

*Winter Wonder*: She would be a reindeer and I'd make her staff something like Mistletoe LB's.

**Lissandra**

*Debonair*: Just imagine her in an evening dress.

*Withered Rose*: They have the eyepatch thingie, just like Liss has her eye covered, good fit.

*Elderwood*: Kinda like a tree since she literally comes out of the ground.

*Broken Covenant*: Her ice is shattered pieces of stained glass.

Omen of the Dark: Again, no particular name just the same skin trio, I imagine a look that's something of an inbetween of Inquisitor Kayle and Blade Queen Liss. Maybe would use black glass for ice.

**Lucian**

*Fast Food*: Dressed up as a McDonald's employee, one gun is a ketchup- other is a mustard pistol.

*Bilgewater*: Basically a male version of Miss Fortune.

*Secret Agent*: Straight from MIB, can't get a better champ for this skin.

*Cyber Pop*: Looking at CP Akshan, I could see this be good.

*Empyrean*: Imagine his spells with RGB effects especially the ult.

**Lulu**

*Little Chef*: Her big hat would be a chef hat. Polymorph turns enemy into some kind of food like idk, a roast chicken.

*Bewitching*: Pefect match for Lulu, surprised she doesn't have a skin like this already.

*Faerie Court*: Same thing.

**Lux**

*Cafe Cuties*: She already has so many skins, honestly didn't want to bother too much with this one. CC is a good fit.

*Lux in Wonderland*: She's kinda like Alice I guess.

*Glamorous Staff*: Something like Splendid Staff Nami.

leagueoflegends,It really seems like Riot is out of touch with how strong their releases are,"This champion, is absurd at all levels of play. The problem is the kit is so overtuned with utility, mobility, and damage, while being relatively easy to play, that he probably doesn't have any counters in the game. In challenger on NA, hes in almost 50% of games via pick or ban, winning 54% of those games that he actually sees play. We have not seen these numbers for a while outside of ADC. This champion is universally understood by the playerbase to be flat out broken. He has a high banrate in every region's challenger except Korea, where it is a modest 10% (not really sure why honestly). 

Turns out giving a champion with solid early game dueling potential a hyperscaling mechanic is a bad idea. This champion is insane and this won't be the only nerf.

leagueoflegends,Why does Yuumi have resists on her ult?,"The goal of the yuumi rework was to skew her towards lower elos and remove tools from her kit that made her difficult to balance (except her untargetability but that's a discussion for another day...), so why does she have an ability that's more suited for a warden?

The reason why you never see Braum, Rell, Taric, or (formerly) Tahm Kench? They had very strong peel abilities, but very little flexibility, so you had to be coordinated with your adc. Yuumi ult can't be used as an engage tool anymore, it's entirely centered around peel, so why would low elo players use this optimally? 

A new player isn't going to be ready to pop ult just before the ADC gets bursted down from an invisible assassin, especially if there is little to no enemies on screen, which is exactly how you would expect to use yuumi ult (an AOE attack) in the first place.

I'd love to know what you think. Please, as always, remember that this is for fun and not made with the idea that it's ready to ship and would improve League as a whole! I simply admire the development team and like to play make-believe that I'm a part of it. I enjoyed the process and am eager to hear the thoughts of those who take the time to read it!

leagueoflegends,[Satire] I’m so sick of this _____ Meta,"I really hate how it’s always the same thing over and over for the past ____ (inaccurately long amount of time). Top is always ___, Jungle is permanently ___ (farming/ganking lanes other than mine), ADC is _____ (useless/only one with agency). The game always revolves around ____ (lane/champ/item that I don’t use) because ____ (name specific top personalities that said so; omit that it was specifically said about pro play/challenger elo and not applicable elsewhere) and this is not okay. It is very toxic to play __ (with/against).

We need sensible balance changes, like ___ (randomly generated and absurdly high-impact change) which would make ___ (lane/champ/item I don’t use) weaker. This will allow for ___ (lane/champ/item I DO use that isn’t actually weak), which is currently very weak, to have counterplay.

This is the worst state the game has been in the last ___ (inaccurately long amount of time written in the beginning). Until Riot puts as much effort into balancing their game as they do selling skins, I’m going back to ___ (Valorant/TFT/Competitive Forklift Racing).",PatellectomyNautilus,08/03/23 03:34:41 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11l8v05/satire_im_so_sick_of_this_meta/
leagueoflegends,Why do most people think Skarner needs a rework?,Title. He feels really strong and has a unique playstyle that forces the enemy carries to take cleanse or qss. His kit does not feel dated to me (although riots idea of dated seems to be if the champion doesn't have something annoying to play against in its kit),Adkeith47,09/03/23 10:44:20 PM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11mtzhl/why_do_most_people_think_skarner_needs_a_rework/

the win rate went up for a bit but now is going down, the only exception is diamond but the diamond curve goes up and down by a lot probably because there are a low ammount of games.

compare it with [veigar](https://lolalytics.com/lol/veigar/build/) or [ahri](https://lolalytics.com/lol/ahri/build/) which got buffed in the same patch, if you look at winrate graph you can easilly say ""here is when they got buffed"" but on the orianna graph you can barely see any difference...

leagueoflegends,Talon Problem please read carfully!!,"Hello! - i am here to talk about the problem with talon 

Note: please read carfully + i dont mean anything rude by this post i just want to clear something in my mind and i think all champs are equal and i personally love them all &lt;3 :)

i think talon is an old champ not just an old champ he is kinda forgotten  so lets talk about why i think that

1- Talon never been in any cinematic.

2- Talon looks very generic as "" The assassin"" so here lies another problem about nothing makes talon special , Talon needs a full combo to excute a full health target in the team fights (""if not behind or ahead"") what you think is wrong about that you may ask let us compare him to the other assassins (Zed : he has the ability to join a teamfight excute a target and runs you may say ""talon has the same in his E"" i would say that zed can decrease cd of his W with just hitting E so where Talon needs a wall to go around so the only ""gameplay"" talon can play is about flank then try to kill as much as possible and dying in the fight cuz any little bit of cc can literally kill you while zed can poke 2X the talon with just WQ which gives him so long range but that talon doesn't have and he can go back to his original place if played well he can go in excute a target then go back to safety so easly and so when dont firget about his ulti it gives true damage on the target on each ability hits and its quite GOOD ) , ( Qiyana : qiyana is a champ that plays around the elements which is quite unique to an assassin but lets talk about her kit Q kinda is a perfect ability which allows her to change her play style with the element she chooses grass can give her inv.s water which can give her ""CC"" which is AMAZING on any assassin , any assassin can appreciate cc to hit there ""Skills"" and i guess last one is called ""Land"" or "" Rock"" i really don't know which has kinda more damage if compared to another ability , Qiyana W can absorb the element that she chooses which has a long cooldown but she can absorb 1 time then wait this cooldown then take another element what i mean is she can have ""grass"" to give her inv.s and wait \*(wait means that she doesn't use her Q to use the element)\* then can use grass again so she can be inv.s twice which talon don't have either her E is a dash which if done correctly can used with the Q to auto lock the Q without the effort of aiming it and Then her Ultimate WHICH IS NOT AMAZING ITS AMAZING AND WONDERFUL AND EVERYTHING her ulti. can push enemies against walls then stun them or in water and auto stun them it needs quite the skill but when handled can win you Team fights on her own) (Katarina : kat everything can reset so we don't need to talk about kat she is quite BROKEN and i love her xD) i can talk about more champs but we can end it here you get my point i hope

3- Talon desgin is quite old and atleast needs update and his VO is terrible and atleast he needs looks update and i guess we cant give him legendary update cuz of his old like kit that doesn't have anything to be special in the legenary skins

4- Talon doesn't sell alot of skins so he is not ""important"" we all can see how important a skins sell these days for a character to be important

5- talon gameplay can be super boring cuz its so so so repetitive not like other champs ""mentioned above"" which have different combos and play styles not like talon that have only 1 combo knows which is ""GET YOUR PASSIVE ASGHNIKSPGHNINIOPAJ"" xD thats the only talon combo known is use W if it hits twice use Q ""in early game"" use W if it hits use ult and Q thats the only combos i can think about ""and i am a talon main myself"" which is not good for any champ and i think alot of old champs have this problem but not all of them

6- Talon is not in legends of runterra or even wild rift so it is showing us and giving us the vibe about how he is not important to put into other games 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

 i hope anyone reads this a wonderful day &lt;3 love you all &lt;33",killyoselfs,09/03/23 08:54:47 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11mdyyt/talon_problem_please_read_carfully/

leagueoflegends,The real solution to inting no one wants to say,"Literally just ban most minors. If you make it an M-rated game, I am almost certain you will cut that behavior significantly. And if it doesnt, I can laugh at the grown ass adult who has nothing else to do but waste 30 minutes of his life feeding in children's games. I don't think 13 year olds should be playing the game with this much racism and homophobia in it anyways. (but this applies to most big online games with chats, which should also have an M-rating. The ESRB should really rate this shit) They also are likely unable to empathize with the adult who only has an hour or so of free time to play this game, so are more likely to feed.",MonkeySleuth,12/03/23 02:35:18 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11ore9d/the_real_solution_to_inting_no_one_wants_to_say/
leagueoflegends,LP increases have improved the ranked experience but there is still is room for growth.,"The LP changes have been a step in the right direction for making ranked play feel less like a grind . But I do believe there are ways to improve the ranked experience from an enjoyment perspective even further. Although ranked is meant to be taken seriously (some of my teammates maybeg to differ) the overall experience should be fun. 

1.  Dodge penalties - I find that the LP loses for dodge penalties are a really harsh punishment for low elo. The queue cool down is definitley balanced and great to keep games flowing, but I feel that the LP loses increasing every dodge is unfair when you have players griefing champion select. 
(I do understand that people dodge team comps as well, but the inability to tell the difference as to why someone dodged a game should be enough to warrant to LP loses and only a cool down.

2. Role selection -  Auto fill and secondary role I believe are key to keeping queue times short, but a function to allow people to opt into single role selection queu for longer waits can help certain players and teams overall not getting autofilled teammates. 
(I don't believe the current system is a problem but this would be a nice QoL change)

3. Performance based LP loses - I think Valorant does a great job at the performanced base LP gains and loses. I personally do not think that LP gains should reflect KDA or performance. But I do think that a loss should warrant somewhat of a supplement for a good performance. The age old argument is that league is a lot mroe than just stats. But at the end of the day we have come so far in stat tracking in terms of vision score and damage dealt, etc. that there should be a way to fairly track a good performance in a bad result and give an LP buffer for those who fall into that category. 

Let me know your thoughts!",HellaGosu,11/03/23 01:51:18 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11nvtje/lp_increases_have_improved_the_ranked_experience/
leagueoflegends,Draven Passive &amp; Toxicity,"Draven's passive creates an interesting problem regarding team play in a SoloQ environment and results in higher instances of perceived toxicity and negative reactions, from my anecdotal perspective.

The design of Draven greatly rewards him for getting a kill, which results in players expecting their teams to play around this passive. While this isn't inherently bad, it does result in situations where Draven players see large rewards when the game is played for them vs when the game is not played for them. As such, they are more likely to interpret not playing for Draven's passive as a negative game outcome and more likely be frustrated.

The other alternative is the game being played for Draven's passive but a teammate denying the cash out from Draven passive. This also creates a negative reaction when the actual result might still be positive. An example being your team for man dives bot lane and secures two kills and denies three waves without having any kills traded back. This would be a very positive outcome. If the AD Carry in this situation is Draven and they were unable to secure a kill the player can see it as a negative outcome. 

I think the passive itself leads to very high highs but can also create negative situations in uncoordinated environments that introduce the opportunity for toxicity. Having exciting gameplay moments is good game design but the social side of SoloQ makes Draven's passive problematic. Draven is one of the characters I don't hate playing against, but rather hate playing with because of how the players who pilot Draven see the game.",N30NWH173,10/03/23 02:23:30 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11mzjun/draven_passive_toxicity/

It wasn't like this back when you could recognize opposing players as Honourable Opponents. I think they should bring back the ability to honour opposing players.

Regardless of their reasoning there will always be a few people in the comments saying, ""if you're supposed to be a higher rank, you would be able to carry your games"" or ""if you can't carry a game you shouldn't be a higher rank"" or something along those lines.  

While I don't disagree with these statements, I don't entirely understand them. I'm a pretty average player, in most of my normal games my lobbies have Silver-Gold or unranked players on both teams. I've been playing for a little over three years now, and from my casual observations, solo carrying isn't a thing that actually happens very often. It used to back when I was new and very bad at the game; I perma-banned Fizz as an ADC one-trick because he solo carried a really bad game I lost.  

But these days, I just don't see solo carries very often. More often than not my games are decided by macro decisions, rather than one player having really good micro and snowballing. It's a team game, so more often than not the outcome is decided by the performance of the whole team rather than just one guy. I feel like this would become more true the higher your rank is - the better you are at the game, the better you would be at playing around a single fed player in order to win, similar to how split-pushing is harder to deal with for low-elo players. I've both won games against fed carries, and lost games WITH fed carries. 

There's obviously more to carrying than just being fed and getting kills, like having good map awareness and being where you need to be at any given point in time. But even if you as an individual player perform as optimally as you can, you can't control what your teammates do even if you try to shotcall. If I ask for something as simple as ""can you drop more wards"" it's a fifty-fifty on whether or not they listen or start freaking out. I'm sure that every single person reading this understands the feeling of having that one teammate that just brings the whole team down, and struggling to play around them.

So where, exactly, does this solo carry mentality come from? Is solo carrying more common in high elo (which I am not), and therefore should be possible for players who are meant to be in those top ranks? I feel like this could be the case if the rank discrepancy is high enough. A diamond player smurfing in a truly bronze lobby could probably solo carry. On the other hand, someone who should be silver would probably have a hard time solo carrying in a bronze or iron game. Does this mean that they don't deserve to rank up into silver, until they're able to carry bronze games?

I'm wanting to understand the mentality and why this is such prevalent advice. Not really looking for tips on climbing, unless it's relevant.",heziilah,08/03/23 02:06:04 PM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11lo78t/please_explain_the_mentality_of_if_you_cant_carry/

first off, I hit Plat in season 12 and also finished the season on Platinum 1. here is my [u.gg](https://u.gg): [https://u.gg/lol/profile/euw1/fex%20namikaze/overview](https://u.gg/lol/profile/euw1/fex%20namikaze/overview). I was honor level 2 with 2 or 3 checkpoints.

Now to the issue. All my friends who where above gold received the victorious Sejuani skin not long after the season ended. I didn't. I thought it wasn't a big deal and waited for some weeks, after which i submitted a ticket and a bugreport via the league client at the end of januaray. then I took a break from League. Now today i logged on to my account again after the pause. I realized immediately that something was off, because i didn't have my Platinum ranked banner in the lobby, so I went to see if i could equip it, which i couldn't, then i checked my profile and it said, that I was unranked last season, which can't be, as I literally played 500 games or something like that. The ticket and bugreport didn't get answered, what should I do?

leagueoflegends,Early Surrender Changed (Again)??,"Just had a terrible League game in which I reported all of my teammates, but what really stuck out to me was that we tried to surrender at about the 17 minute mark. Despite the vote being 4-to-1... it didn't go through? Even though Riot very clearly, announcement and all, changed it so that you can surrender at 15 minutes so long as you have a 4-to-1 majority?

I saw no notifications nor announcement about this. It's annoying because that tilting-as-fuck game went on for nearly 20 minutes, but also because I was practically gaslit by my botlane insulting me and saying I was off in my own world. Despite the fact that this change was made in preseason/start of season where both Riot and the community made a big deal of it.

So what, did I miss some sort of announcement about reverting to ""unanimous early surrender"" or did the patch fuck something up?",Kagimizu,10/03/23 04:55:38 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11n3ic9/early_surrender_changed_again/

leagueoflegends,Infecting terrain or camps Champion Idea,"So I was hoping Bel'veth would be like this, as they really showed her ""taking over"" and ""summoning things"" but she was NOT what I expected.

Or maybe they could alter the jungle's terrain directly? Essentially what if the gameplay loop of the champion revolves around taking over terrain to get more powerful and they unlock or evolve certain abilities based on how much of the map is terraformed to their liking? I would love them to be a mainly macro focused champion but you know, still has to set up, so they could always be stopped from applying pressure to lanes (and if their power is based on terraforming land then invades would help counter them). It's just an idea so not really thought out but I love the idea of making the gameplay loop around infecting terrain or monsters.

leagueoflegends,problems of NA server,"introduction of myself

been across on and off league since season 4

diamond in kr server (season 4 &amp; 12) and in na server (season 9)

currently changed my position to top and plat 1 in na server

&amp;#x200B;

This is my 4th time on the grind of climbing to diamond and my first time feeling actually ill whilst playing soloq

I don't have high ego or try to make Korea server fascinating but na soloq is terrible. 

I know every server has their own problem. Koreans are generally or mechanically better than na people but comparatively have weaker mentality.

But when it comes to people in this server I feel like talking to the wall. There isn't any better description for these people I think. 

This is what happened to me yesterday. I was on the same team with this draven and vel koz one trick guy as bot and I asked them if they could ban veigar &amp; yuumi as they're quite broken right now.

They ignored me and obviously the opponent took veig &amp; yuumi straight away. Our bot was crashed, both recorded 7 deaths before level 8, then our vel koz goes ""maybe I need to ban yuumi next game""

&amp;#x200B;

I have come across so many trollers throughout my league life, someone who said ""MY VOICES TELLING ME TO RUN DOWN"" in champ select then kept dying with teemo support, someone who suddenly inted with heccarim cos he just didn't like our adc, someone who flashed and swore at everyone else saying stop pinging me.

&amp;#x200B;

I was mentally stronger than average people. I wasn't even mad or emotionally drained when I played with those people. 

But na players are whole another level. It wasn't like this at least back in season 9. Maybe that season was easier for me because I played mid? I don't know

One thing I'm sure is this season is quite draining.

It's not about meta. It's about people. I don't want to blame a specific position, but most na junglers play in such a weird way and they are generally quite emotional with high ego.

Like, I played against camille in top and made her low hp at level 2. our jungler started blue coming to top so did the opponent jungler. I pinged him gently to come top and get her and we could win 2vs2.

He ignored me and carried on jungling whilst the opponent jungler came and flashed on me.

In another game, me and my mid weren't able to push waves until level 6 cos we were countered and I asked our nocturne if he could do reverse jungle. He ignored me and then did 6 camps. I pinged him again not to go take the scuttle crab as I and our mid couldn't go and help. He ignored me again and the opponent mid, top, and jungler were near the crab. He flashed and smite on the crab and died.

&amp;#x200B;

I apologise if I sound ranting about junglers only. I just played with a load of those people no matter which position they choose, just saying that comparatively there's so many junglers who just ignore pings and mute everyone else.

&amp;#x200B;

I tried to talk to them in the beginning. Well, they didn't reply obviously until the end, then one of them accepted my friend request and answered why he played like that.

He said ""Can you play perfectly in every single game? then why do you care about the way I play? gg trash""

&amp;#x200B;

Also, I realised there's many botted accounts that got the same queue with plat 1 &amp; diamonds. I never saw they won the lane and I am tired of them. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've been feeling ill now since I lost my 2nd game in promotion to diamond yesterday. Not because of the outcome, I also failed in promotion like 5 or 6 times back in Korea server, but because of people I'm playing in this elo.

I love playing league of legends but feel vomiting and fever from it. So, I decided to take a break from soloq and watched league of legends videos on YouTube. It made me vomit.

I don't know anymore. Have you guys watched any videos of troller's gameplays and laughed? I would just laugh it off as well but this time I had to pause the video because it gave me such a headache and reminded me of trollers &amp; stubborn people I played with.

leagueoflegends,support as a role needs adjusting,"yes i know yet another person saying support is broken, but this is ridiculous. im a adc main (low elo) im not saying that support champs are op and need nerf or something like that the champs are fine some are more annoying than others but thats all lanes, my issue and what seems to be a common issue across all elos from what i see and watch from others is simply, support as a role has wayyyy to much sway on how adc's get to play a game. 

like i get supports should and do have a sway on the bot lane but at the same time there is no reason why a ADC plays a good game, and i mean like isn't dying, csing well, getting a kill or two even and staying even with enemy ADC, but the supports are playing the ""who can fuck over their adc the least"" game to determine which ADC gets to play that game and which one gets to sit there and twiddle their thumbs. it happens all the damn time where as ADC you play just fine but for whatever reason your Yuumi support decides to ks two kills early and make your lane a 1v2 to just end up having to try and play the catch up game and end up losing.

I have over 70 skin shards (used for rerolls of new skins) and about 85k in orange essence.

Instead of just being a post of just what I think they should be used for, comment on how you think riot should handle excess orange essence and how to differentiate it from other currencies like RP and Blue Essence.

leagueoflegends,Stuck in ARAM,"As the title says, you can get stuck in aram.

I booted up league for a quick and fun game of aram. When a random teammate, playing Fiora, flashes behind a statue at spawn. I find it funny and do the same. Because he has a dash, he gets back in front of the turret while I'm stuck behind it at spawn. I then get a warning for AFKing and my team remakes the game.

Again, you can not get back from this position unless you have a champ with a dash or blink and have to wait till you get flash back off cooldown. Don't do this, unless you want to :)

Spending so much time on such an unfixable problem is a waste of resources.,"Deep down we know Yuumi will never be 'fixed' as long as the untargetabilty remains. It's a conceptual problem.

Way I see it, she has to completely suck to the point where she is de facto not part of the game for this issue not to be visible.

She can't be buffed up without being a huge problem again, and again, and again, and again.

- All the pro play-prison champions like Azir, Ryze and so on.

- Bigger systems that people are discussing: catch-up experience, mage items, top lane satisfaction

- Planned reworks such as Skarner.

leagueoflegends,"If I have a player in my team that spams FF and the team manages to win, that player should get reduced LP for this win","Everyone knows this situation right? You play a ranked game. The game might be looking dire, it might be even, in some cases you might even be ahead.

But then there is this one rat person. That one person which probably died once in lane, maybe twice or more and starts spamming FF as soon as minute 15 hits despite the game being perfectly winnable just because they miss the crucial skill of being able to let themselfes get carried.


Now everyone knows that League is highly reliant on momentum and I understand that sometimes, after your team got aced at an objective you feel like FF'ing and start that vote.
I dont want to argue for reduced gains after the first vote. I want to argue for reduced gains after the third vote started by one singular player.

With how much Riot has been trying to promote not being toxic I think its a step in the right direction.

Its a the mental tax you should have to pay for being a bitch ingame and only fair imo.",iamjackslastidea,13/03/23 04:42:30 PM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11q4aat/if_i_have_a_player_in_my_team_that_spams_ff_and/

leagueoflegends,"It seems that the Broken Covenant Skin Showcase will not include missions with rewards. The FAQ for Skin Showcases implied that showcases would always include missions, but Riot sneakily changed edited that as well... or tried to.","[Source: Matty Love Gaming's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMAXnmHPf_o)

In fact, according to [Riot's FAQ on the matter](https://support-leagueoflegends.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/5364355902227-Skin-Showcase-FAQ) at the moment of posting this:

&gt; Showcases are approximately 3–4 week long promotions within a single theme and feature new champion skins and accessories to match. They are also accompanied by a number of Showcase missions and rewards.

Which, in fact, still implies that we should have missions with the Broken Covenant Skin Showcase, and here is a [screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/ZdkFglP.jpg), in case they edit that out too. In the question about the missions specifically, it used to say:

&gt; Showcase Missions are missions, not unlike Event Missions, that accompany a new Showcase debut. Missions can be viewed in the Panel below your friends list in the client.

Now it says:

&gt; Before we go into the details, just a quick note that not all Showcases have missions! If that's the case, your only objective is to grace the Rift with your stylish new look.
&gt; 
&gt; Showcase Missions are missions, not unlike Event Missions, that accompany some Showcases. Missions can be viewed in the Panel below your friends list in the client.

Not only were they sneaky about it, which is hilarious considering their recent promise of communicating better, but as you guys can see in the very first question, its still implied that all Showcases come with missions and rewards, so even their sneaky attempt at covering that up failed hard.

**UPDATE:** [Riot Rovient responded to this situation.](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11n75xb/it_seems_that_the_broken_covenant_skin_showcase/jbp4yhf/)

&gt; Apologies, players. This one is on me! I was unaware that we had a commitment to Showcase missions. We'll make sure we get these free rewards into an upcoming Event in addition to existing content.

leagueoflegends,Riot REALLY needs to change the requirements for ranked queue,"I just lost a game due to two players being completely new to ranked: One of them was an ARAM only player who was clearly not very experienced, and decided to try out ranked for the first time, and the other was a level 31 player who's very first game against other people was ranked, and was VERY clearly completely new to the game and had no idea what was going on. Obviously, they both give up kills like crazy, the enemy is up 8 kills by 8 minutes, and the game is over from there. Our ADC who was  paired with the new player went giga-toxic towards them, and basically gave up 10 minutes in.

I'm not gonna pretend like this happens every other game, but I can distinctly recall something like this happening roughly 5 times to me this past week (maybe 20-25 or so games). I feel like the requirements for ranked queue are WAY too loose, and it encourages new players to try it and end up with a bad experience. From what I can tell, the level 30 minimum requirement just translates to ""Grind out a bunch of bot games, and once you're 30, you're ready!"", which is obviously not the case. In my opinion there should either be a minimum number of draft games played before ranked (maybe 50 or so), a much higher level cap (75-100), or some kind of mission checklist before hand (get a certain amount of vision score in a set amount of games, get a number of KP/assists, or just straight up a number of draft games won). The current system does nothing to tell new players that ""Hey, unless you're a smurf you are absolutely not ready for ranked"", and it bogs down the quality of games in the average elos, (which im sure reddit is familar with), while also giving a really bad experience to the new player.",bongodongowongo,12/03/23 12:38:19 PM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11p5dhp/riot_really_needs_to_change_the_requirements_for/
leagueoflegends,Skin ideas for every champ - K,"Hello everyone!

Preparing for today's post took a **lot** of time because there are 14 champs with K, so let's just get into it.

**K'Sante**

*El Pantera*: A wrestler/luchador skin would fit K'S perfectly I believe given he has almost cartoonish top heavy proportions.

*Beast Hunter*: I mean he already is one so all you have to do is just push this fantasy a little bit further, maybe give a bit of beast fur and bones as part of his outfit and it's good to go.

*Mecha Kingdoms*: Again building on his 'big man' theme I came up with this, his weapons could also be fun with a big mecha.

*Executioner*: Aaaagain, his bodytype matches this fantasy too, plus I could imagine a couple of things could be done with his weapons as well.

*Mythmaker*: I just found this skin fitting for him, can't give any particular reason why.

**Kai'sa**

*Bloodstone*: A normally unappealing skin line but think of the red crystals on Taric's and Liss's splashes and put those in place of Kai'sa's cannons and hand shooter....thingies. Finally she could have an evil look.

*Firecracker*: Both the Q and the W would work very well with this.

*Omega Squad*: This could work with her suit, kinda like bullet angel, but less space- and more military-weaponary based tech.

*Battle Falcon*: An Anima Squad skin, again, with her suit she could fit this group, like a weaponised superhero suit. Falcon is exchangeable, didn't know what animal to give her.

**Kalista**

*Huntress*: A prehistoric/tribal vibe skin, simple fur clothing, no armor, no helmet just throwing basic stone spears. Her hopping passive especially fits this theme I think.

*Sewn Chaos*: Transform Kal into a doll and isntead of spears, pierce her through with sewing needles! Her bond passive is a thread.

*Guardian of the Sands*: Base she is a spirit so she could easily become a mummy here and in general egyptian vibes are not too far from her I think.

*Infernal*: Spears of flame, her long hair could be on fire too, works I believe.

**Karma**

*Three Honors*: If you've seen TH Malza, you know that that vibe fits Karma exactly.

*Spirit Blossom*: Very elegant, gentle, nice colour palette, would no doubt match Karma.

*Lunar Eclipse*: I'd put a shining little moon symbol or something on her back which changes its phases and becomes a full moon every time you activate the ultimate. In a similar fashion, both her Q and E could be changing moonphases. I'd give her back her short hair, but make it black with white parts in it. Only thing questionable here is if it's a problem or not, that she already has the 'Sun Goddess' skin.

*Coven*: With her being female who also uses magic she could easily fill this forest witch fantasy.

*Underworld Priestess*: A more evil skin - even more evil than coven -, with a devil/demon/infernal approach. Her R+Q could be kinda like Brand's W, with a portal that shows hell through the circle so if you look down, you could actually see the realm and then a burst of fire erupts and the portal closes. Similar chain-like effects on the W to Ruined Karma. Claws, demonish looks.

**Karthus**

*Battle Boss*: He definitely could work as a final lich boss, even in an arcade enviroment.

*Dark Star*: Mostly I found the spell effects fitting for this: Little exploding black holes on the Q, orbitting dark cosmic dust on the E.

*Guardian of the Sands*: Mummy look, sand particles on abilities.

**Kassadin**

*Debonair*: I imagine a similar look to D Zed, since he also has a mask and the hand blade.

*Dreadnova*: Leaning more into the Darth Vader fantasy.

*Blood Moon*: Just a generally cool skin line, that works on cool assassins, like Kass.

**Katarina**

*Battle Cat*: Honestly this champion is so drained in terms of skins, I could barely come up with anything that hasn't been made in some form already. This one is an Anima Squad skin, can't say much, she's just fitting here. Kinda like how they made a new version of Battle Bunny Riven into this skin line, the exact same thing could be done here with Kitty Cat Kat.

*Shockblade*: Assassin, check, just put some lightning effects on her abilities, could make her ultimate into a living storm, maybe white or dark blue hair and boom done.

*Dark Waters*: Diana has this skin, thought since they are both female assassins with blades, this might look good on her too. They already share two skins, why not this one too. Just don't make it too similar to her pirate skin.

**Kayle**

*Arcana*: She has some Arcana style in her deafult splash already, that's why I thought of it. Could work.

*Withered Rose*: Make her the villain already. I'd give WR with black wings to Kayle and Crystal Rose with white wings to Morg, I think it woud be a great duo skin that keeps their contrast but switches the sides. A bonus is that WR skins have this eye patch, which would be really fitting for Kayle thematically, who's blinded by her own sense of justice.

*Ashen Judge*: Ashen skins have wings, armor, what else do you need, perfect match.

*Faerie Court*: Butterfly wings.

**Kayn**

*Beast Huter*: His big scythe sounds like a good weapon for killing beasts and I like the idea of a beast hunter that's also half-beast.

*Elderwood*: Leaves for hair on shadow Kayn, antlers for Rhaast.

*Astronaut*: A little alien vibe, where he might survive or the alien inside them kills them. The transformation could have a special animation for this, so when eg. you choose Rhaast, he comes out through the belly for the reference. You can infect others the same way with your ult. Q and W might have some space effects and E is basically zero-gravity floating. Recall could be something like the glass of the helmet breaks and he starts suffocating. After all, it's a horror movie.

**Kennen**

*Storm Dragon*: Kennen was surprisingly hard to find skins for, he's juts really too simple, yet his elemental theme kinda doesn't work with anything... This one for sure doesn't hurt that, although I'm not sure how much it adds to it either. Either way it can have some cool spell effects.

Empyrean: Same here, for the cool spell effects, not much else to say. And these are the only ones I could think of, sry Kennen mains.

**Kha'zix**

*Black Frost*: Many void champs have this skin and I also gave it to many already, gonna do this for Kha too. His blades could be like the ice has frozen on his 'arms' in a shattered blade shape.

*Alien Invader*: He could be the leader of this insectoid alien species from an other planet that wants to invade Runeterra to study its inhabitants and eventually eat them to evolve and become the strongest species in the galaxy.

*Jurassic*: Like the other void jurassic skins, dinosaur skeleton.

**Kindred**

*Dragon Trainer*: Wolf is a dragon.

*Omen of the Dark*: Couldn't come up with an individual skin name, but this is a skin line which I feel like would work super well on Kindred. Especially talking about the trio skin of Kayle, Noc and Singed. The aesthetics of those three are immaculate for them. They are death themed which is obviously good here, and they also have some emphasised masks, which is also great for us: Lamb could have a mask like Kayle, while Wolf could have a mask like Singed. Keep the black smoke body for Wolf and give Lamb some similar accessories to what the three have, maybe some spikes, chains etc.

*Blood Moon/Snow Moon*: Dark red smoke effects for Wolf, blood moon symbol stacking up on the E, a bigger version of that one on the ult, and naturally some fitting blood moon masks for the two.

*Guardian of the Sands*: Sand effects for Wolf, egyptian style masks, a bit of gold and jade.

**Kled**

*Sheriff*: A High Noon style skin, but this felt like a better name. Skaarl could be some desert lizard like HN Tahm, and obv Kled is the sheriff. Hat, badge, pistol, the usual stuff. Q is a lasso.

*Prehistoric*: Skaarl is something between a frilled lizard and a raptor, Kled is dressed up as a caveman.

*Bad Santa*: Speaks for itself. Skaarl is a reindeer.

*Urf Rider*: Kinda speeks for itself again. Skaarl looks like Urf the manatee, Kled's weapon is a spatule.

**Kog'maw**

*Little Dragon*: He's a dragon, spits and vomits fire.

*Sugar Rush*: Made up of sweets, spits and vomits chocolate, vanilla, ice cream etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Finally done. See you tomorrow. :P",lissandrafootjob,10/03/23 04:47:33 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11n3b1x/skin_ideas_for_every_champ_k/
leagueoflegends,I genuinely don't know how to have fun playing ranked anymore,"I don't know what to do anymore. Games just don't even feel rewarding or fun anymore. Even when I win, it just feels empty. Games are either stomp or get stomped. Ranked doesn't really feel Fair. I queue up a few times a day to try to win a game, but I proceed to have multiple Duos on my teams and if one gives up, the other gives up too. All of a sudden what's supposed to be a 5v5 competitive game mode turns into a 3v7 because a duo decides to stop trying. What am I supposed to do about that? I read posts telling me to focus on improving and I have been. I climbed from silver all the way up to Platinum as a solo ADC Main.

I try to be nothing but positive in my games and encourage people that games are still winnable. I'm nice to people only to get flamed in about 80% of my lobbies. I have recently started to use the new deafen command which helps my mental a lot in games but it's not enough.

I don't know what it's going to take but if something doesn't change about this game I'm just not going to play it anymore.

Tyari’s and her allies’ immobilizing abilities consume all stacks of cosmic radiance to extend the duration of their immobilizing effects by 0.25 seconds for each stack of Cosmic Radiance. 
- Cosmic Radiation’s stun extension is unaffected by Tenacity.

Q: Second Second
- First cast: Shoot stardust through a wormhole in a line 1 second after cast dealing 65/90/115/140/165 (+45% AP) damage to all enemies it passes through  
- Second Cast: Summon a meteor to fall through a wormhole in a small area nearby 1 second after the first cast dealing the same damage again.
Enemies marked with Cosmic Radiance that are damaged by either cast will be stunned for 0.75 seconds.

W: Weight of the Wait
- First cast: Tyari gains a 100/150/200/250/300 health shield 0.5 seconds after cast for 1.5 seconds.
- Second Cast: Tyari summons a burst of solar radiation through a wormhole in a small area for 2 seconds dealing magic damage every 0.5 seconds.

E: Wormhole Reckoning
- Tyari channels for 1 second, opening a large rift under himself in a circle. All units standing above the rift are grounded and slowed by 90% for the duration and are dealt 25/30/35/40/45 (+10% AP) magic damage every 0.25 seconds. Tyari can use other abilities during the channel.

R: Hour Time
Passive: 
- Tyari gains 10/20/30 ability haste.
Active:
- 3 seconds after casting, Tyari summons stardust through a wormhole to land in an hourglass shaped area, dealing 150/250/350 (+80% AP) magic damage, and stunners all enemies for 1 second, increased to 1.5 seconds if the damaged target is immobilized already.

Inspiration: LoR’s card by the same name. The idea of Aspects (like Zoe, Diana, Leona, Pantheon, etc.) is wonderful and exciting, and this is my take on an Aspect that has only been seen in Legend of Runeterra. 
Also inspired by Syndra, Ekko, and the idea of all-or-nothing combos and prediction. 

Thoughts: Since this champ is super susceptible to ganks due to the delay in ability usage, I wanted to build survivability in Tyari’s kit. I think I can still do a better job, probably make her passive based on survivability instead (which I kinda did but it’s still tied to landing abilities) but this is my take so far.
I wanted Tyari to have damage over time abilities that would apply Tyari’s passive mark to be triggered by both first and second casts of Tyari’s Q, Second Second. But it might be OP. 

Open to all criticism and input, thanks for reading, seriously! Take care!

leagueoflegends,Champ to add at my pool?,"Hello everyone,  
pretty straightforward: what champ should I add to my pool? I am a midlaner.  


I feel like I want to have a different champ to use midlane, to adjust to the situation.  
I am currently main Annie or Asol (when he is not banned).  


Otherwise I play Viktor or Neeko. When everthing is banned, it happened lol, I play Malzhar.  


I feel that Neeko is not that impactful, maybe I am wrong.  


Who can I add to my pool? I was thinking about Lissandra but I am not sure. I am trying Sylas in normal a bit but I feel a bit ""meh"" sometimes.

&amp;#x200B;

\--

A collection of how LCK treats BRION badly with a lots of 'coincidences'

If you don't want to hear fans of unpopular teams whining, go away

This is a story about BRION, an LCK league of legends pro team

1. McDonald's card incident

[Even if composition of players in each position of the photocards is idiot-like, BRION is the only team not here\*](https://preview.redd.it/tqo946pg6zma1.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=8fd7b6da9fe78441d8784aa150df937021529c24)

2. Forfeit against GENG due to COVID situation

In esports, it's possible to have an advantage when playing non-face-to-face in the LCK, so there is a rule that the 2nd team must be called up for a 1st team player gets COVID since they cannot come to the game. 

But when BRION went to call up, almost all their 2nd team got COVID, so there were no players to play

https://preview.redd.it/pz2px9429zma1.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=381b0e64ce15af63764048fa05c07a28b25d7428

In the end, Brion had to forfeit from the match against GenG, but the reasoning the LCK gave was that 'there was a limited scope to reschedule'.

Why was the schedule limited? Because the Asian games selection, which was stupidly not held. In fact, the selection was cancelled too because they are idiots\*

(Brion was not a bottom team at the time, but in play-offs contention. In the end, Brion had to beat Damwon, a strong team, in order to get to play-offs but against these odds, they beat them 2:0 and went to play-offs)

**Also, the 1st team only had to forfeit the GenG match, but the 2nd team, a CL team, ended up forfeiting 3 matches.**

3. LCK Awards incident

Brion was the first team to arrive to the LCK Awards red carpet, but only their entrance was cut

The players were not interviewed, let alone caught on camera

Brion content team was invited and treated badly

The awards given that day include - Bald head award (awarded to the player who was most commonly bald in YT thumbnails because they played a bald champion)

Brion content team - created Killing Voice and Lookbook contents for 2022 and exported them to T1, GenG, KT, etc.

[Brion's content team PD's insta story at the time](https://preview.redd.it/oh6mlg0ybzma1.png?width=850&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=9c2323377c122f6e500302535abae9e0bbed2101)

Note that Brion's leader bought the players tailored suits with private expenses for this dinner

4. BRO-KT game side selection mistake

[ Thank you to the fans who always support Brion, and we ask for your support for the players who are participating in the game while taking damage for the stable development of the league.\* Thank you.](https://preview.redd.it/ahd9m5nrfzma1.jpg?width=1000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=90564f00f42469cdc81f693922a7fdc25847057f)

Brion's post on the day

Brion and KT were discussing what to do, but LCK enforced the broadcast

[Nothing was said about enforcing the broadcast in the apology post](https://preview.redd.it/o9i9kdhcgzma1.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=2adca06b007ccc7f5627120f4497e58161a95864)

Due to this incident, Headcoach Choi Woo-Beom (Edgar) was unable to sleep due to stress

[In addition, this match was stuffed in next week's Mad Movie](https://preview.redd.it/j5f6bvbwgzma1.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=acfd53bf8caafec3264973273401acc1e8ccef0b)

5. Mic Check

In the LCK, players' voices are edited and uploaded during matches, which is called mic check.

Currently, the LCK Spring is in its 7th week, with a total of 6 weeks worth of mic checks posted.

Check the mic that has been uploaded so far

[As of today, even DRX came out](https://preview.redd.it/tr4orwuhhzma1.png?width=1019&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=0ea7c0d556c4cf7e645dff8b7b22ea2f59ee0083)

 Currently, Brion's ranking is not even 10th but 7th, and NS KDF DRX, which is ranked lower than Brion, also comes out. 

 For reference, Brion's remaining matchups are GenG LSB DK KT NS (order not known), and except for Nongshim, all teams are stronger than Brion, and mic checks usually come out when they win. 

&amp;#x200B;

Q&amp;A

Q: It's because you guys aren't popular

A: In the world of esports, the most popular team and player is T1 and Faker; LCK does what they want to them too

Q: You didn't even get any awards, so isn't whining about not getting awards too much?

A: It can be, but if so, why invite the content team?

Q: You guys don't spend money

A: We are the team of the LCK that has rightfully entered the LCK franchise by paying an additional 2 billion for 10 billion subscription fees and for coming from Challengers Korea.\*

Some people may think this is just our team's business, speaking plainly do you think this league that does this to T1 and Faker isn't going to fuck with you? 

I did this for public interest purposes, but I was afraid that I would get dizzy if I unpacked it, so I took a break and posted\*

leagueoflegends,Matchmaking Explanation,"I understand this thread has been done half to death but Im still genuinely confused. How do I improve my matchmaking? How am I supposed to understand this picture? This isnt a new thing either, though I did just come off a loss streak that brought my overall winrate down from 59% to 55%. All season Ive been getting matched against people below me in ranked, with sub 50% or barely 50% winrates. And once I hit silver my average MMR has remained bronze in most games but my LP gains dropped and losses rose from when I was getting through bronze.

leagueoflegends,"Every time mythics got nerfed because of bruisers abusing them, but nobody seems to ask why bruisers need another class mythics.","Jak'sho was nerfed because of bruisers, eclipse was nerfed because of bruisers twice, shieldbow was nerfed because of bruisers, now prowlers is gona be nerfed because of bruisers.

At the same time:
 Stridebreaker and Trinity sit on comfortable 1% pickrate, gore sits on 2% pickrate while Sunderer have 6%.

Ah also we cant forget about Riftmaker, one and only AP bruiser muthic that have even less pickrate than all above.

Bruiser class effectivly have one mythic: divine sunderer. Champions who cant use divine effectivly go eclipse. Gore and stridebreaker dont exist if you are not lee sin/garen. Trinity has worse build path than rabadon while not providing as much stats.

Other classes have unpopular or underwhelming mythics like crown or mandate, but bruisers have one mythic items that they can use.

Why those mythics are unpopular? Lets look on mythic design of other classes: ADC lacks burst, mobility and surviveability. Adc have kraken, galeforce and shieldbow that ate xover those weak spots. Mages are different so they mythics too. Mage lack reliable cc? Build Everfrost. Lack followup? Nightharvester and protobelt is here for you. Lack survivability? Build RoA to get free 600 hp or crown if you are a clown.

What weak points of bruisers cover their mythics? Are you having build in omnivamp? Too bad then because gore will not alow you to survive 1v3 and run away unless giga fed anyway. Do you have a tool to get on top of your target already in your kit? Too bad then you will never apply stridebreaker slow to a kiting adc. Are your champ good at splitpushing. Too bad no point in building Trinity then. Are your champ can use sheen? Build divine.

Fed bruiser ment to win duels in the melee range as well as fed adc ment to win teamfightsif not in the melee range of assasin/bruiser. Adc gets tools he needs for this. Bruisers get only win duels amplifier(divine and trinity) while items that should allow them to have more chances against ranged champs(stridebreaker) or in teamfights (gore) are nerfed to the ground or does not have functions they need to. Also mythic that alows bruiser to be frontlainer to a team is not exists at all because there is no bruiser mythic that gives you resistances.

Divine is uninteractive and unfun item at the first place while also being overtuned as hell needs to go as the only mythic for bruisers so you can have some build devercity in the class",Crime_of_Prometheus,13/03/23 04:39:56 PM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11q48rn/every_time_mythics_got_nerfed_because_of_bruisers/

But we can see the same logic here, if u ban 5 ADC's u just disrespect Gymayusi and just hate him, and all u team need to be kicked because you all are just bad persons IRL and personal attack people in game for nothing. 

So reddit, where im wrong?",shattered_god,13/03/23 03:16:09 PM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11q2wtd/5_adc_ban_and_stll_wont_banned_in_competitive/
leagueoflegends,Can the subreddit let go of deleting champions,"Every day. Every day without fail, for months.

""Yuumi is an inherently flawed champion because of X, she's a pro play nightmare because of X, she has a frustrating mechanic and I don't like it and riot won't respond to it""

It is incessant, it is infuriating. Riot gives a statement on why they won't remove it and everyone collectively groans and nit picks.

The champion WILL NOT BE REMOVED. like it or not, even if she teaches bad mechanics, players like to play yuumi. A lot of players. Even if their reasoning is ""we want her to be a new player champ"" doesn't mean everyone has to point at the flaws of positioning. Even if she has a frustrating mechanic, even if she is completely unique in her design or gameplay. She will not be removed

I beg of you guys, please start giving constructive feedback. Removing/lowering resists on ult is constructive. Removing/lowering the slow on q is constructive. Removing her tether/her from the game, is NOT constructive. It's like asking riot to remove singed from the game or removing his poison because you don't like it. It's like asking to remove Morgana root. It's like asking to remove jhins 4 shot. It's like thresh lantern. It's like asking to remove aatrox auto attack drain tank bruiser playstyle",EZ_POPTARTS,12/03/23 03:35:51 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11osx33/can_the_subreddit_let_go_of_deleting_champions/
leagueoflegends,If the new Midlane assassin is a hybrid skirmisher im gonna be upset,"The last 3 “Assassins” they’ve added have been hybrids with other classes. Yone and Viego are Assassin/ Skirmisher hybrids, and Akshan is an Assassin/ ADC hybrid. They all have assassin qualities, but none of them build or play like true assassins. I really hope this time when they call a champ an assassin, they actually mean it. The last one was Qiyana but she honestly lacks qualities other Assassins have like a reliable escape tool and instead has a bunch of hard CC which is odd for an assassin to have",Far-Chicken-3080,09/03/23 08:26:17 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11mdavg/if_the_new_midlane_assassin_is_a_hybrid/
leagueoflegends,"Swain's satisfaction and fantasy issues, explained. Alongside a very do-able Ultimate rework for riot to consider, making him a DPS scaling battlemage, similar to Pre-VGU Swain and moving him away from the utility mage identity Rylais has turned him into.","We're about to do a deep dive and an analysis on Swain's current situation. Brace yourselves :)

Swain midlane pickrate: 1.00% as of 13.5

He's the 2nd lowest pickrate midlaner, after Neeko. And she's getting a mid scope.

Swain currently has these **2 core satisfaction and fantasy issues**:

**-Mediocre (below expectations) scaling**. The champion has  an unhealthy 1st item powerspike interaction with Liandrys, so riot had  to nerf his ratios to bring that to a balanced state. In turn, however,  the champion lost scaling power which he really shouldn't. His fantasy  is a scaling battlemage, ever since he got released in 2010.

(note: I am not saying he should scale like a Kassadin / Ryze. But definitely better than he does now.)

**-Rylais needed EVERY game.** This problem relates with the previous  one. With low ratios, Swain is not rewarded for building higher AP  items. That and how his current R design works (relatively high cooldown, low drain damage ratio, low ratios on basic abilities, Demonflare being a one-time cast) forces  him to buy Rylais every single game (especially in higher elos). If it  wasn't for rylais, there is literally no reason to play Swain over  something like Kassadin, Anivia, Viktor. Rylais itself on Swain,  however, disrupts his fantasy of a battlemage and it should be turned  into an OPTIONAL item, similarly to how it always has been, up until the  mid scope happened.

As a Master Swain top/mid OTP with 2 million points on  him ( I play him 2+hrs everyday). I'd like to suggest this rework which solves these 2 problems.

(Note: If Riot comes up with anything else that solves these  problems, I am totally ok with it. However, I strongly believe this  adjustment that I am suggesting is honestly the ultimate solution. I've  considered budget, player satisfaction, champion's fantasy, Swain in the  support role and high elo - pro play)

---

**Q:** 70% AP Max ratio &gt;&gt;&gt; 80 or 90%

*(Optional: Ability to pierce champions REMOVED)*

(Thoughts: Swain's main DPS ability. Deserves a higher ratio. With the nerfs to his early game powerspike from itemization (which I'll explain later), this will be doable, so Swain players will finally feel like they do damage when they hit a full 5 bolt Q. About the removal of ability to pierce champions: I believe Swain having one spell that is focused on big single-target damage is good. The champion's entire kit is AoE, his Q can be single target.)

---

**W:** 55% AP &gt;&gt;&gt; 70%

---

**E:** 25% outgoing , 25% incoming &gt;&gt;&gt; Outgoing damage REMOVED, 60% incoming

*(Optional QoL and buff for Swain vs melee: New: Swain can recast this ability to make it return sooner)*

(Thoughts: I put all of E's damage on the explosion. Even though this will hurt waveclear (however, consider his Q got better ratios, that will help with waveclear), the satisfaction of hitting a good E on people will be much better now)

---

**R:**

Cost: 100 mana &gt;&gt;&gt; **X mana per second (perhaps increasing every second) (Maybe 25/50/75 mana per second?)**

Demonic Energy REMOVED

**Cooldown: 100/80/60 &gt;&gt;&gt; 40/30/20 or 25/20/15** (To be completely honest, the R cooldown could be kept the same if we don't want Swain to be a lane bully in top or want him to push waves like crazy. But Swain players have the most fun during R, so I believe buffing the cooldown a bit is a good change, obviously while nerfing some parts of the R (demonflare) )

Magic Damage per tick: 10% AP &gt;&gt;&gt; 20% AP

Heal per tick: 18% &gt;&gt;&gt; 15, 12 or perhaps even 10%

**Demonic Ascension can be deactivated by recasting it.**

R2 (Demonflare):

Damage: REMOVED

Slow 60% &gt;&gt;&gt; 30%

NEW: Demonflare is now not castable. It casts automatically every 5 or 10 seconds of draining at least one  enemy CHAMPION.

(***OR*** *Demonflare now automatically casts upon casting Nevermore (E) ) (This would remove some of the skill expression, but perhaps it would make casting E during R more satisfying. This change could happen paired with removal of 20% CDR of E during R)*

(Thoughts: I am trying to not remove Demonflare due to work that has been put in VFX, SFX and it would be a shame to throw all of it away. HOWEVER, I believe that removing demonflare all together would be a great change

In a case of R2 being removed entirely, I would add this passive to Swain's ult: NEW: Swain gains 10/15/20% magic penetration based on his ultimate's level.)

NEW: Demonic Power bar indicator is now turned into Demonflare charge indicator.

Demonflare SFX audio volume lowered, so it can relate with the ability's impact

---

**With this simple R rework and a few numerical adjustments:**

Liandrys 1st item powerspike removed. (The low healing in R,  alongside the new mana / second, will make RoA's eternity passive optimal for Swain to have acceptable healing. I believe RoA should be Swain's optimal item to fix his current issues, but also it's obvious how well it *theoretically* synergizes with Swain's kit, as it always has, until it got removed from the game)

With Liandry's 1st item strength removed (alongside R2 damage  removed), there is more than enough room for ratios buffs in the  entirety of Swain's kit, making him a good scaling DPS battlemage, similar (a bit) to Anivia.

Having good DPS and good ratios in his kit, Swain players will be  rewarded for building high AP items (RoA, Demonic, Cosmic, Seraph's) by  doing more DPS. This, alongside the new lower cooldown on R, will help  on making Rylais (FINALLY) an optional item, as it should have ALWAYS  been.

Swain players, mains and OTPs will finally be able to feel the  fantasy of the champion as a good scaling battlemage, and not a utility  mage, as the mid scope turned him out to be.

Thanks for reading. If you have any further questions or need any further explanations, please comment! :)

---

*Edit: Something I forgot to include, is that perhaps his passive HP stacking would need some nerfs after these adjustments. It would be unhealthy to have a late game Swain have 5 or 6k HP with RoA and still have insane damage output + healing. However his builds would be full AP, so maybe having a high HP pool would be balanced.*

*Edit #2: Some notes about why I don't think his E ability should be reworked even though many consider it unsatisfying:*

*I've  also believed that E is a badly designed ability and didn't feel good  to use. But his E does exactly what it is designed to do, but also it  does exactly what it should do in this kind of champion (battlemage).*

*You  shouldn't think of Swain's E as an engange ability. It's not. It's not a  Naut Q, it's not Zac E, it's not Blitz Q. Think of it as his small CC  tool, like Anivia's Q, Viktor's W etc.*

*Swain should be played as a good follow-up all-in battlemage.*

*If  you're anxious about it because you don't gain passive stacks, don't  be. His stacks aren't like Asols. They aren't what make the champion functional. I've had many matches with Swain where I didn't have any stacks  until long into the game but I still managed to help my team win the  game.*

Some notes about me, if it helps with the credibility of the post:

I started playing LoL some time before Swain's big 9.14 rework. I started by playing every support I could find, mostly enchanters. I really liked their gameplay of saving teammates. Back then I had NEVER heard of this champion. Didn't even see him much in my matches. A fellow support player, said he likes playing Swain in support. Me not knowing this champion, I was excited and curious to see what his kit would be. And then I honestly fell in love. I think I started maining Swain after 9.14, and I honestly couldn't stop playing him. His thematic, similar to someone like Tywin Lannister / Darth Vader / Darth Sidious made me fall in LOVE with him, alongside this AMAZING fantasy / gameplay of his ultimate. 

Ever since then, up until now, I've collected 2 million points with Swain, played him in every role I could, top, mid, support and adc (sometimes even jungle). Now I've climbed with him up to Masters with Mid and Top as secondary. His kit really makes more sense to be a top laner, but idk why riot forced him into support. I mean, I discovered him through the support role, and it was fun playing him support in lower elos, but in my current elo it honestly feels (to me) unbearable playing him support. 

I loved his mid scope at first. I was one of the many (back then too) asking for changes almost every day. Even though I met Swain after 9.14, it was his pre-VGU version I related most to and I only dreamt of playing. I've come to the conclusion, his pre-VGU version was the most stable one. The mid scope did a good job with the infinite R rework and it helped his gameplay, but unfortunately with Swain's itemization and ratios being balanced around Liandry's and Rylais, it keeps his good scaling fantasy away from his current gameplay.

From my countless conversations, thinking, failed rework ideas, reddit posts, etc, I've found this solution to fix current Swain's problems while bringing back the *scaling* part of his fantasy that faded away with the mid scope.

Nowadays, a lot of time of my day to day life is about forwarding my ideas to rioteers and the community so hopefully the champion can change for the better, not only for me but I believe for the entirety of his playerbase.",Manos132,11/03/23 10:30:48 PM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11oll1d/swains_satisfaction_and_fantasy_issues_explained/

**2) Qiasuo** = Like Qiyana but more auto attack centric. Also controls the wind and walks around barefoot.

**5) Qioric** = Tall woman with a shovel that digs up ghouls. 

**6) Qilia** = Like Qiyana but dresses up as a deer and can put people to sleep.

**7) Qizix** = A cute girl who is really into bugs and resets.

**8) Qicarim** = Same as above but really into horses instead.

leagueoflegends,"March Madness: A Primer on Collegiate League of Legends, Part 3: The East Conference, Groups C and D","Welcome back to part 2 of the East Conference! If you want to see my general thoughts on the conference, my thoughts on the North Conference, or the format of the entire season, check out my previous posts. 

# Format Change

Since yesterday, there have been two large changes in how the remainder of the season will play out. First, the reallocation of College Championship bids based on the most updated conference alignments, and second, the re-inclusion of head-to-head as the first tiebreaker over game losses. While I’m not sure if the H2H change will affect anything I’ve written, the conference alignment change does! Previously, the conferences were ordered:

· South – 4 bids

· North and East – 3 bids

· National Esports Collegiate Conference (NECC) – 2 bids

· West and remaining partner conferences – 1 bid

Now, primarily due to the movement of 2021 champion Winthrop to the NECC, it has switched to:

· North – 4

· South and NECC – 3

· East – 2 

· West and remaining – 1

Obviously, this is great news for the teams in my first write-up, but it's rather poor for the teams in the current one. But now it's time to see who will join Western, Toronto, and Harrisburg as the favorites competing for those two bids. 

# Group C

With no teams from this group ever qualifying for the College Championship and seven teams in contention for a playoff spot in the final week, Group C is undoubtably the closest group I’ve seen yet. Group C is led by **New York University (6)**, but like Group B, no team here is undefeated. NYU qualified for playoffs for what appeared to be the first time last year, but quickly went down in the play-in game in a 1-3 loss. This year, NYU has only lost to **Rochester Institute of Technology (22)**. NYU has already played their final game, so they’re locked in at 6-1, guaranteeing a top 2 seed into playoffs, with first place contingent on Rochester Tech’s final series. 

Speaking of **Rochester Institute of Technology (22),** they are showing the strongest group stage of any team under seed 20, at 5-1. Rochester has never qualified for a conference playoffs, and fortunately for them, they’ve already locked it here. This weekend they’re matched up against **Ontario Tech University (27)**. A loss there could knock them as low as the four seed in the group, while a win would guarantee first place. 

At current third place is **Temple University (14),** who is quite unpredictable due to having only played 5 games thus far and sitting at 3-2. Their remaining two matches are against **Juniata College (19)** and **Penn State (11)**, both of whom currently sit in the bottom half of the standings, with Juniata being winless. Win either and they lock a playoff spot. Win both, and they could compete for the 2nd seed depending on the outcome of other games, but lose both and they’re staring down elimination and praying on tiebreakers. It’s best that they take care of business this weekend and not have to worry. 

The last likely team for playoffs is… hard to determine. With just one weekend left to play, there is a possible five-way tie at 3-4 (which would include the above Temple), so I’ll quickly run through what each team needs to do to lock or lose their respective playoff spot. 

First, **Ontario Tech (27)**. With their current 3-3 record, playoffs is not within their ability to lock on their own. If they win, they’ll sit at 4-3, which *should* get them in, but leaves the possibility of a three way tie with Penn State and Temple, where they would be at the whims of the second tiebreaker, game losses. For Ontario Tech, they should be aware that winning 2-0 vs 2-1 this weekend could determine if they qualify. 

**Boston University (3)** is poised to be the first top 4 seed to be eliminated from postseason contention. With their 3-4 record, they can no longer influence whether they qualify, and their only hope is that every game plays out perfectly to form a large tiebreaker, where they pray that nine losses gets them in over the bunch. 

Thanks to having played one fewer game than other teams at 2-3, **Penn State (11)**, has the most control over their destiny. Should they win over both **Temple (14)** and **Johns Hopkins** **(30)**, this weekend, their final record of 4-3 would be enough to qualify unless both Ontario Tech and Temple won this weekend, at which point it would go to a game loss tiebreaker. Lose both, and you’re eliminated, but beat Temple and you have solid odds of the tiebreaker heading to game losses. 

The final team in contention with a 2-4 record is **Johns Hopkins (30),** who can qualify off a tiebreaker if they finish the season beating **Penn State (11)**. Still, that would require Ontario Tech to lose or Temple to lose both, and only sends their qualification to game losses. The most important thing for Johns Hopkins to do is win their match this week and do it 2-0. 

Sorry **Juniata (19)**. At 0-6, you’re the only one not invited to the party, but you can still make things interesting by beating **Temple (14)** this weekend. 

# Group D

Group D is always interesting because of the seed clumping caused by the snake draft, but this one has gone mostly to chalk. Four of the teams here have qualified for playoffs in the past two years (remember, it was more difficult prior to this year), and one has been to the College Championship (though most recently in 2019). That team was **University of Waterloo (4)**, who is already locked at the top spot. While they could fall to 6-1 this weekend, they already own the tiebreaker on the only other team that could achieve 6 wins. 

That team is the **University of Toronto Mississauga (13),** at 5-1, also locked for playoffs. They most recently qualified for playoffs in 2021, where they lost to Harrisburg in a close 3-2 in the quarterfinals. However, all five players from that roster have since left. Since they own the head to head against the only team that could achieve a 5-2 record and lose to head to head against the only team above them, they are locked at the two seed in the group. 

Finally, something somewhat interesting, **McMaster University (5)**, at 4-2, has only lost to the two aforementioned teams above them. They made the playoffs last year, where they lost in the 5-6th place match to York University, a loss that cost them a College Championship bid. With two teams at 3-3 below them, they are not yet locked for playoffs because of the possibility of a three way tie. 

The two teams tied for 4 and 5th place are **Rutgers University (12)** and **McGill University (20).** However, those 3-3 records aren’t created equal. Rutgers owns the head to head tiebreaker, but has an extra loss to **McMaster (5)**. On the other hand, McGill has yet to play McMaster, who they should be unfavored against. This weekend Rutgers plays **Stevens Institute of Technology (21)**, who sits at 1-5, while McGill challenges McMaster. If they both win, there would be a three-way tie at 4-3 with no head to head winner, so it would go to game losses. If McGill wins and Rutgers loses, McGill takes the three seed, McMaster the four, and Rutgers is left out. If McGill loses, regardless of the outcome of Rutgers’ match, McMaster takes third, Rutgers fourth, and McGill is left out. 

That leaves three teams already eliminated from playoffs, **UMass Amherst (29)**, who could finish 3-4 and tie with Rutgers and/or McGill, but loses the H2H with both, **Stevens Institute of Tech (21),** and **Brock University (28).** Best of luck next year. 

# Conclusion

That covers the last half of the East Conference! At a glance, these last two groups have fewer teams favored to make the College Championship, but could surprise people in playoffs. I’m going to try and get the primers on the South, West, and National Esports Collegiate Conference in the next few days then run through any notable remaining partner conferences before playoffs start.

leagueoflegends,My entire process to significantly improve aim + map awareness 'hack',"Here is my entire process for *SIGNIFICANTLY improving my aim* (with a map-awareness hack additionally) 

--------------------------------------

**Overview**

* Aimbooster.com - check your aim **(before and after comparison!!)**

* Marks Mouse Fix regedit

* Wndows mouse settings

* Mousepad check

* Mouse software (shitty mice don't have this)

* Aimbooster again, and practice tool

* Rinse Repeat

--------------------------------------


**Aimbooster.com** , just hit Default mode and play... Your friend can use this tool every day before his first game to warm up his aim... This thing works awesome! (I was doing 20 seconds before getting up to 1-2 minutes, drastically increased my aiming)

Also Aimbooster has another setting for 'Twitch' , which helps with fast skill shot aiming

((also with aim booster I noticed I had to learn to use my eyeballs to focus on targets instead of having a glazed-out sort of visual perception, and the game taught me to keep that precise targeting with my eyeballs staying longer and steady,. It's actually really hard to watch every single click you actually make))


--------------------------------------

**MOUSE FIX**

go to *Mark's Mouse Fix* http://donewmouseaccel.blogspot.com/2010/03/markc-windows-7-mouse-acceleration-fix.html?m=1 , do this registry edit for screen size/windows OS version

Go to Paint, see if you can freestyle draw a smooth circle (without the regedit, your circles may have a constant jaggededness instead of smooth)

Make sure his Mouse Sensitivity is set to 5 (default) and turn OFF Mouse Acceleration.

(Also download necessary mouse software , and his mouse might just suck, also he might need a mouse pad... If you are using a shitty mousepad, that alone will fuck your aim up)

If I recall Faker uses lower DPI on his mouse settings, what worked for me was lowering it, and calibrating it for Twitching my mouse like on aimbooster , or kiting/orb-walking , so that my mouse didn't felt natural , like not overshooting/undershooting and having to correct it, with a lean towards undershooting , to allow for better precision of clicks.


--------------------------------------

GO TO **PRACTICE TOOL**

Settings

* Disable Bot

* Disable Minions

* Disable FoW

* 0 CD

* Drop multiple practice dummies in jungle in random places.

Now your friend needs to go around the targets , flashing to different spots, and hitting intended target. *Challenge Yourself!*

Rinse+repeat for 5 minutes.

**Sidenote**

* Make sure in practice tool you check you can fully execute your entire combo *fast* 
* Check the damage output of various items for reference 

--------------------------------------

Also Also **Map Awareness Hack** go to YouTube and look up a Metronome with a clicking sound ( look for something like 20 BPM, or so it clicks every 4-6 seconds) everytime it makes a click sound LOOK AT THE MINIMAP

--------------------------------------

leagueoflegends,Skin ideas for every champ - N,"Hello everyone!

Let us carry on with today's letter, N.

**Nami**

*Astronami*: Since we arrived to 'N', I realised that there might be other champs with N, who can fulfill the same pun as Astronautilus. I know she has a cosmic skin aaand a program one already, which latter is kinda similar in visuals, so I'm not entirely sure of the whole concept.

*Cafe Cuties*: She is indeed cute plus you can colour her spell effects to fit the theme like with Vlad.

*Lunar Empress*: No idea lol just found it somewhat fitting, maybe it's not.

*Giant Enami/Prehistoric*: A prehistoric style gigantic shark monster. :D Kinda like Ripjaws from Ben 10 xddd

**Nasus**

*Astronasus (aka Laika)*: The other candidate for the pun.

*Good boy nasus*: Listen. I know he has Space Groove, with the little doggo, that's really good, I admit it, thumbs up. And he has Archduke, that's good too, no denying. But none of those two justify the fact, that you LEFT HIM OUT OF THE CATS VS DOGS SKIN LINE. THERE IS PRETTY. KITTY. RENGAR!!! WHERE IS GOOD BOI NASUS??? DO YOU HEAR ME RIOT?! WHERE IS-

Kh-hm, apologies. Moving on.

*Dark Star*: I find it really fitting. Put a black hole in his staff and every time he Q's, the life force is consumed by the bh and that's how he stacks. E could be basically a galaxy. And the R... 'd be sick.

*Urf Champion*: Same idea as it was with Jax. Urf costume, spatule for weapon. Actually it probably fits Nasus more than Jax, cause the spatule is a little closer to his staff than Jax's lantern and Nasus is more 'iconic' if you could say that, in urf cause he can stack much faster.

*Freljord*: Put together Braum and Tundra Hunter Warwick. There you have it.

**Nautilus**

*Mecha Kingdoms*: A giant mecha nautilus emerging from the sea, sounds like it could work, to me.

*Elderwood*: Wooden body, anchor is twisted roots, couple of leaves here and there.

*Victorious*: Haven't used this skin line before, so thought, why not. I imagine it as something like a prestige version to Warden.

**Neeko**

*Arcanist*: Somewhere between Arcanist Zoe and Bewitching Neeko. Little trickster mage.

*Beeko*: No idea how it would look like, but I like it.

*Definitely Not Neeko*: Pretty sure it's not just me who came up with this idea, but that just shows more how good of a concept it is. It's just fun and fits her character perfectly.

*Dragoneeko*: She's technically a cameleon, that's technically a lizard and dragons are technically big lizards. Can't argue with this.

*Prehistoric/Dino*: Similar idea, either a real or a Dino Gnar kinda dinosaur. I already hear her say ""Rawwwrr!"" in her voice.

*Space Groove*: Fun, goofy skin line, perfect for Neeko.

**Nidalee**

*Battle Cougar*: Anima Squad skin, a shapeshifter superhero, I think it works.

*Blood Moon*: Cool skin line, cool champ, can't really explain it better than that.

*Wildclaw*: DnD/Rift Quest type of skin. In dnd there are druids who usually can turn into animals, that's why I thought of it. Name can be changed.

**Nilah**

She only has Star Guardian so far and I really like her and she's a good material anyways, so I gave her a couple more than usual:

*Explorer*: Indiana Jones!

*Arclight*: A wip of light.

*Battle Queen*: Like Kata and Diana. Even by lore she is a mighty fighter, works well I believe.

*Lion Tamer*: Self-explanatory.

*Sandstorm*: Indiana Jones but more shuriman. Like Sandstorm Katarina with a whip and sand spell effects.

*High Noon*: The whip works here too.

*Ruined*: Evil joy. Would really be interested lore-wise, what would happen if she became ruined. They could let her hair out.

*Dawnbringer*: Just a cool hero skin for her. Could have really nice spell effects. Might try white hair with this one.

*Invincible Dragon*: A dragonmancer skin. This could be absolutely badass. Could give any element or colour theme really.

**Nocturne**

*Dark Star*: Dark theme, good for Noc. I imagine the Q would look really cool with cosmic particles.

*Sand Wraith*: Surprised he doesn't have a skin like this yet. His ghostly body could be made out of sand and his blades wouldn't be as dumb as they usually are. Imagine Sand Wraith Pyke without legs and his dagger on both of his arms. Kinda like that.

*Blood Moon*: Kinda fitting. Assassins always work with BM.

**Nunu &amp; Willump**

*Trick-or-Treat*: As always, snowball is a jack-o'-lantern. Eating an enemy with Q shows a little candy emblem like how Final Boss Veigar shows the Rylai's. Nunu is perfect for trick-or-treating anyways. They could wear different costumes based on the chroma, the bossibilities are endless.

*Fuzz Friends*: Willump is a cat rolling a big yarn ball, Nunu wears a little dog/cat costume.

*Sweeper*: Snowball is a football. If it hits someone it makes a ""Goal!"" sound effect.

&amp;#x200B;

leagueoflegends,So... why don't caster minions deal AP damage?,"This question haunted my obsessive brain for the past 5 years, and I finally thought to ask

It was probably asked before, and I'm guessing the ultimate answer must be something like: ""because it's always been like this""

But I'm more curious to know if that would change anything at all. Does implementing this change break something in the game mechanics? does it alter how the wave and wave management work? or would it be inconsequential overall?

EDIT: Ok, I hate edits, but clarification seems necessary: THIS IS NOT A SUGGESTION. IT'S A REFLECTION.
I'm not saying they SHOULD deal magic damage because they are magic casters. You could bring a million examples of mage champs who ""AuTo AtTaCk"", it's not the point. I think Riot's gameplay before lore approach is well known to everyone by now, and that's ok.

I'm trying to reflect on why they made them that way despite the normal sense suggesting otherwise and, more importantly: what COULD change in game mechanics and the way we deal with waves if they actually adopt this change.",elasri1,09/03/23 02:20:36 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11m3rd1/so_why_dont_caster_minions_deal_ap_damage/

This guy Bender also managed to join the multi platinum selling band of edgy casters alongside vedius and european Eminem.
But I think the best part is that Lender keeps trying to fool us into thinking he isn't a new addition to the cast. I don't know about you guys but I have never seen this guy before. Finally I have to give kudos to the tree segment with the handsome swedish toplaner, it was pretty fun to see how he builds this confidence as a new guy to work in such a low budget to bring so much content.

I feel like this isn't the first time this has happened, but this is the first time I have bothered to clip it. If I am somehow wrong, I am fine with that, but I need some kind of info as to why this happened, so I can avoid it in the future.

leagueoflegends,Decision making when ahead of the enemy team.,"Just a general question on what to do when you're ahead of the enemy team in everything. Had a game recently where our Aurelion was very fed, and I'm playing as Jarvan. It's around 20 minutes ingame, all of us are 2-3 items in, including the Aurelion. He has more than enough damage to destroy everyone if we just group and siege mid, but he decides to just split for the next 10 minutes of the game so he can get his ""spike"", which was Rylais. Keep in mind he could oneshot everyone at this point with his current build. In the meantime we forced a fight or two while Aurelion was merely a couple seconds away from joining the teamfight, but instead of helping he just went for krugs and continued to split top.  


What should I do in this situation? Am I in the wrong for wanting to force teamfights since we're ahead? Or should I have just let him split and focus on getting drake soul or baron to end?  


Obviously I know i can't control what my teammates do, but I want to know what the most optimal move would be.

Okay, no, this is just an elaborate riff on him having been the buggiest champion in the game but come on, he'd totally ROCK this look.  


So hey, since I couldn't decide on which fairy court would fit him best I just made two versions. Hope you enjoy my little take on the thematic, this time around with 300% more bugs.

leagueoflegends,How would you actually make good AP items without the game becoming a mess?,"I have been thinking about this for a while now and I'm not sure if it can be done. The way AD and AP are designed makes AD items much easier to design than AP ones.

Bruisers want HP and Resistances to get as much value out of their autos and abilities as possible and have higher base damage to allow them to build into more defensive builds without being one shot. They may opt into 1 attack speed item but nothing more. Juggernauts often only build a maximum of 3 damage items because they are a DPS sub class and living long enough to deal damage becomes more important.

Assassins want Lethality and Armor Penetration as they are are ability casters and dont have the base damage for tankier builds but in exchange have incredibly high bonus ad scalings and as they are squishy, they need to be able to one shot and get out so they can't build attack speed or defensively.

Marksmen want Crit Chance and Attack Speed and on hit effects unless your name is Ezreal. Auto attacks have a lot of parameters that increase their DPS far more than lethality would. Most of their damage comes from their auto attacks and their abilities generally are aimed to amplify those auto attacks.

Skirmishers want lifesteal, on hit, a bit of durability and for a select few crit chance. They have enough mobility and defensive tools (insert jacques copy pasta) that let them build more damage. Skirmishers aren't as cut and dry though as some may build more like Divers while some may build more like Melee ADCS.

This system, while not perfect, thanks to it's many parameters keeps champion classes intact as much as humanly possible without hard restrictions, allowing diversity for some champions to choose into more high risk or low risk play styles if they wanted to. But because of this system, if an item is being shared being classes, something has gone seriously wrong. Goredrinker Kayn and Talon shouldn't work but it did because the item gave too much damage for how much survivability it gave. Eclipse before it lost its 6 Lethality was extremely good at one shotting squishies while being extremely good into tanks with BC and Serylda's, so everyone was building it. Death's Dance also got nerfed because all AD champs were building it. Because of the system in place it's pretty clear when an AD item is broken.

Moving back onto the topic of the title, AP as a system does not differentiate between the subclasses of mages at all which prevents mages from getting items more specific to to maximising their strengths and instead mitigating their weakness. We've all seen Sylas's doing assassin levels of burst damage with his basic abilities despite his passive and w making him better in extended fights. Every mage goes Rabadon's and Zhonya's. Mages have abysmal (and I mean abysmal) early game armor because every mage is balanced around building Zhonya's, which I'm sure many of you will all agree, is the band aid of band aid solutions. Imagine if an AD Rabadon's existed it would be insane. This leads to AP items being super boring generalist items, because if a single one is good then it will be used on someone who isn't really supposed to be using it and it gets nerfed. If you look at AD champions Darius, Zed and Jinx don't share a single item. Not one. This allows AD items to be better at fulfilling the champion's core gameplay fantasy without breaking their inherent weaknesses. This cannot be said of mages in the slightest.

**TL;DR: AD items have far more parameters instead of the few that AP items have that allow for more specific items and ""soft restrictions"" stopping champions from building items not in their class unless the item is seriously broken, which gives AD champions more diverse and satisfying itemisation choices that AP champions can't have unless some bigger system wide changes are made.**",Lord_Vino,08/03/23 01:52:51 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11l63wa/how_would_you_actually_make_good_ap_items_without/

leagueoflegends,"(Fan-Made) Alune, The Spiritual Seer","Alune, The Spiritual Seer

Passive: Moonlight Serenity
- Alune radiates Moonlight in a large circle (700 range) around her constantly. Other Allied champions who are basked in her Moonlight gain a shield (1% max health per second) that grows over time up to a maximum of 5/7/9/11% of their maximum health. This shield quickly degenerates upon stepping outside of Alune’s Moonlight.

Q: Luminous Grasp
- First Cast: Alune throws out a beam of Moonlight in a line in front of her, latching on to the first enemy unit hit, dealing 70/110/150/190/240 (+ 80% AP) Magic Damage, stunning them for 1.5 seconds. The stunned enemy unit is marked as Exposed.
- Second Cast: Alune dashes towards the stunned unit, stopping at her attack range’s limit.

W: Soul Soother
Passive: Allies basked in Alune’s moonlight gain 5/15/25/35/45% attack speed.
Passive: Allies basked within Alune’s moonlight can click on her to quickly dash to her location, granting both Alune and the Ally champion 6/10/14/18/22% movement speed for 4 seconds. Static 20 second cooldown.

E: Moonlight Radiation
Passive: Enemy units who stand in Alune’s Moonlight passively gain stacks of Moonlight Radiation. Moonlight Radiation stacks quickly degenerate upon stepping outside of Alune’s Moonlight.
Passive: Enemies with 100 Moonlight Radiation are marked as Exposed for 2 seconds. Exposed targets are revealed for 2 seconds and can be basic attacked by Allune or Ally champions standing in Alune’s Moonlight during this time, from any range, to consume all stacks, dealing 50/75/100/125/150 (+30% AP) bonus magic damage, rooting them for 1 second. Static 10 second cooldown.

R: Lunari’s Prophecy
Passive: Ally Aphelios basked in Alune’s Moonlight can choose which Moonstone Weapons to wield next by opening the shop.

Active: Allune prays, channelling to protect a target Ally champion. Alune begins channeling immediately gaining a 30%/40%/50% (+4% per 100 AP) maximum health shield for 8 seconds. During this time, 100% of all damage that would be inflicted on the protected Ally Champion is dealt to Alune instead.  The protection ends when the shield gained by this effect breaks. At which point, both Alune and the protected Ally gain Soul Soother’s movement speed bonus.

Inspiration: 
Aphelios + Thresh lane. Heavily inspired by Thresh’s kit, but I envisioned Aphelios’ sister Alune being a support champ laning with him. Also I hated how Aphelios would get stuck with a bad combo of weapons right before important team fights and wanted Alune’s kit to have some way for Aphelios to choose which weapons to wield.

Open to all criticism and input, thanks for reading!

This game has never been in such a poorly balance state for both pro play and solo queue. Mage Mid+Bot Duo decide every game JG exists as a second support for the ADC. Every pro draft is Bot lane focused Hyper carry+enchanter or lane dominant ADC+poke champ then Control mage mid+ weakside top+ Engage JG to setup the broken ADC.

This is what the top of Challenger looks like across the KR, EUW and NA. Top laners basically don't exist. Almost every JG or Mid in the top 15-20 plays Sylas or Syndra.  The bot duo makes up the vast majority of players. 

Carrying as a fighter isn't a thing, Assassins are trash outside of a few outliers that benefited from offseason item changes, playing for top to carry and not the ADC is trash, playing to scale as a JGler is trash. 

Can we stop with the better bot duo wins meta? Like even the bot laners don't like this type of meta because Junglers live in the botside of the map when the meta is like this.",Flash_4_Crab,08/03/23 02:40:45 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11l7exy/league_of_legends_is_its_worse_balance_state_in/

Why this build? - Duskblade resets are insane during teamfights and does good dps during laning phase. - Beserker Greaves gives Jhin AD because of his passive. - Essence Reaver for big damage numbers on his 4th shot. Sheen proc is based on 100% base AD + 40% AD from items. - Since Jhin gains bonus AD from attack speed and crit chance items, Manamune/Muramana gives him the most AD in one item (160\~175 AD at level 18/full build).

This means you have a couple weeks to grind some blue essence from the champion capsules! I hope this post helps alleviate any confusion about the champion price update.

leagueoflegends,Milio voice lines tease at new darkin champion Naafiri,"Milio has a few voice lines directed at the new darkin assasin that all hint at what their kit might be.

""So many dogs which ones like snuggles the most, Naafiri""

From this is we can guess that Naafiri will have abilities relating to dogs.

leagueoflegends,How would you guys improve the « ping » system ?,"Hello guys first time posting on this sub and I wanted to share my (unpopular? ) opinion. 

Why aren’t ping a privilege ? I mean we all know how the community of this game works and when pings where introduced players found the « ? » ping and, obviously, turned it into a bad behavior. 

Most of the time if a player show bad behavior I mute him first message, but then he starts spam pinging which I also mute. Which result in me , playing a team game, on a duo lane but with 0 communication with my mates. 

Which result to my question : Why isn’t riot doing anything about the bad behavior concerning pings ? I really liked the idea at first as it was an effective way to communicate without having to use the chat, and I would have agreed to totally delete the chat as pings and emote could be more than enough IMO.

So here are some of my idea, of how I would improve the system :

- As I said , the use of ping could be a privilege, if you reach honor 3 for example your « worthy » of using pings and making shout calls. Another approach could be to restrict pings less and less until honor 5.

- Report abusive usage of ping , as dumb as it sound I don’t think it would be that hard to recognize when a players spams ping (if 90% of a player pings are towards a teammate it usually stinks )

- Allow a « lobby only » ping, because sometime you are just trash talking with your friend on discord , but pinging « makes the gap » between discord and lol ( if it makes sense to you). I also believe that lots of pings are misinterpreted because of that.
 

I understand that some of those solutions have flaws but I’m really curious about your opinions / ideas !",BreehJah,10/03/23 11:38:17 PM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11nsdki/how_would_you_guys_improve_the_ping_system/

leagueoflegends,Should Chempunk Chainsword have 65 AD instead of 55?,"Does anybody else think this item is lacking somehow? Every time I build this thing, its like I can feel the damage being stripped from my champion that I otherwise would have gained by not building it...I get that the utility here is for grievous wounds application, but I don't think buffing the damage on this item would give it the Ravenous Hydra effect where it instantly becomes broken and everyone buys it, because it still has a very specific niche for purchase. I just think the item could be a little more worth buying. But I have no clue about how Riot looks at changing items or item balance. I mean, how many times would AD champions take this over Thornmail, Mortal Reminder or just building items with higher damage stats and skipping the buy altogether? I don't know... I think there may be good room for an upgrade is all I'm saying.",BasedPantheon,11/03/23 06:25:42 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11o2umf/should_chempunk_chainsword_have_65_ad_instead_of/

leagueoflegends,How are accents/dialects reflected through translations?,"This question assumes that all of the original character design and linguistic nuances therein are based in English, and are then translated so that non-English speakers can ideally enjoy them. This got me thinking, how are the accents and vocal mannerisms of champions represented in the translated voicelines?  
For example, do Fiora’s Korean/Japanese voice lines account for her French accent? I would imagine it would be hard to find a person that speaks both languages and has a job as a dedicated voice actor. And the languages are so phonetically distinct I feel that it would be hard to pull it off artificially
Other examples include Lillia (Scottish/Irish?), Akshan + Nilah (Hindi?), K’Sante (West African)  
I’m sure voice actors take their jobs very seriously and want to perfect every component of the champions speech including inflection, emotional volatility, social and cultural mannerisms, etc. So how would they go about incorporating the accent into the voicelines",Pandini23,10/03/23 07:02:03 PM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11nm2jf/how_are_accentsdialects_reflected_through/

My opinion so far:

She seems quite strong. The shielding is insane, and her Q is super fast. I have a hard time imagining her not being a problem in pro play right away, they love yuumi zeri and it seems stronger than ever. She has a 56.5% WR with zeri as her adc with 16k games.

leagueoflegends,Runes being changed automatically,"In ranked lobbies no less I have had two games now where my runes have been swapped out from my custom runes to what riot thinks I might want.

leagueoflegends,What has ranked come to,I don’t understand how riot rewards / punishes players for playing ranked. Recently riot put out patch 13.4 which was supposed to allow players to gain more Lp while losing around the same if not a little more for losses.for the first day this was awesome I was gaining 20 and losing 22-23. Which allowed to me to actually climb for the first time in about 3 seasons. The only issue is now that it’s been out for a couple of weeks I’m now gaining 14 ( the same fucking amount I was gaining prior to the update) and I’m losing 28-36 LP per loss. Why is this happening did my mmr go down? I’m maintaining a positive win rate by 40 games.,envirvi,08/03/23 09:07:43 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11lhnp8/what_has_ranked_come_to/

leagueoflegends,The good thing about Yuumi's design,"I can already imagine the effect that title is going to have, so I'm going to preface this by saying: no this is not going to be me ranting and raving about how great Yuumi is. As she stands, even after her rework, she can feel real bad to play against and with. I don't particularly like her, BUT I do like what she represents. Or, at least, what I hope she represents.

In 162 champions (144 at the time of her release), I'd argue Yuumi is the first champion to have a truly unique gameplay pattern. There were other champs up there too, like old ASol, focussed on maintaining his weird mid range positioning, and to some degree Orianna and her ball and Ivern's whole deal, but none to the extent of Yuumi. For better or worse, in her case

I initially came to LoL from Heroes of the Storm as my MOBA of choice, and the first thing you really notice shifting from that game to LoL is the comparative samey feel of LoL's roster. For context, where LoL has assassins, marksmen, mages, etc, HotS had a class known as 'Specialists' that each had completely unique playstyles to basically every other character on the roster. While often niche picks, or normally mained rather than splashed, they were a really cool and fun addition for players who were willing to put in the time to learning them. I've listed some examples here, but you can skip to after the break if you don't care.

\---

Zagara essentially plays Splatoon, trying to cover the map in 'creep'. She places nodes that spawn creep around them, and gains speed and vision while on it, at the cost of being crippled while not. One of her ults even lets her set up hex gate style tunnels between different points of creep.

Murky, who, while pathetic, is capable of overwhelming enemies by just throwing his body at them over and over again. Kills on him only count as 1/4 of a kill, and he's able to spawn an egg from which he respawns after only 5 seconds.

The Lost Vikings let you play an RTS in your MOBA by having 3 seperate characters you had to constantly toggle between and control, with each being very weak alone, and even together being worse than your average character, but in exchange for being able to apply global pressure.

And finally you had Abathur, HotS' take on Yuumi. Abathur plants himself down somewhere, and is able to grant 'Symbiotes' (hats) to allies anywhere on the map, with effects similar to if a Yuumi was on them, at the cost of being extremely vulnerable if the enemy found where he'd planted himself.

I want to clarify I'm not suggesting any of these designs would work in LoL (except *maybe* Zagara copium), just giving context to what can be healthily done in a MOBA with some flexibility.

\---

What unifies all of these characters is they each play completely uniquely to the rest of the roster, to the point that if you were to try and emulate their style on anyone else you would be bordering on trolling. And that's what Yuumi does too (as anyone who's seen a Yuumi bot try and play Taric could tell you). While Yuumi's execution may have left **a lot** to be desired, the fact she shows Riot are willing to branch out and try some more unique champion and gameplay designs is, in my opinion, a really good sign, and I hope to see more of this in future. Just maybe a little less... feline, and untargetable next time.

tl;dr: While Yuumi definitely missed the mark, she shows Riot are willing to branch out and try more unique champion designs, and while I hope we don't get a Yuumi 2.0 any time soon, I do hope we get some more odd ball designs like her in the future.",BadRequest121,11/03/23 07:41:44 PM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11oi3e0/the_good_thing_about_yuumis_design/

* What's the difference between a lower level ticket and a specific section and row ticket?
* Will upper level tickets be released? Or are there no plans for it?
* I'll probably be attending alone. Anyone want to meet up and hang out before or after the games? Where can I find these meet up for these kind of events? I'm coming from Canada if I attend so I don't know how you American youngsters do things.

leagueoflegends,[SATIRE] 5 ideas on how to force Yuumi to detach,"Everyone agrees that Yuumi, as an almost permanently untargetable enchanter,  is the perfect champion for beginners. Right now, she is encouraged to detach to use her passive, but it's clearly not enough. We want new players to have fun walking around the Rift by themselves. So here are 5 new ideas on how to make sure our favourite cat has a reason to stretch her legs.

#1. *I MUST FEED, NOW!*

Once every minute, Yuumi become ***Hungry***. She is forced to detach, and all her abilities are replaced with Cho'Gath R, **Feast**. She must eat a unit to become ***Well-Fed***, healing her to full and allowing her to support her team again.

#2. *FELINE HUNTING INSTINCTS*

Yuumi, as your typical housecat, tends to display tendencies of bloodlust and savagery. After minions spawn and after 30 seconds without a takedown, Yuumi is ***Bored***. She is ***Silenced*** until she gets another takedown, in which case she becomes ***Bloodthirsty***, increasing her movement and attack speed by 20% for a while. (applies to her **Host**).

#3. *MY NAME'S YUUMI, AND YOU'RE WARM*

*Sitting next to a fireplace sure is cozy. Although I don't know how much Brand appreciates his feline friend*. After being ***Attached*** for 20 seconds, Yuumi detaches and falls ***Asleep*** for 10 seconds. During this time, she is targetable by allies, who can also attack her to wake her up.

#4. *MAN'S 2ND BEST FRIEND*

Yuumi starts the game ***Feral***. While attached, she ***Looks Down*** on her **Host** and refuses to cast any of her abilities (Except W to detach). When getting assists with a friendly champion, they toss her a piece of the scraps for her to munch on. This gives them 1 stack of ***Tolerance***, up to 3. Each stack allows her to cast Q, then E, then R. At 3 stacks with any champion, they become her *Best Friend* (same as live), and she is ***Domesticated***, allowing her to cast all abilities on any of her teammates. However, if her *Best Friend* is slain, she is *Devastated*, and all stacks are lost.

#5. *Hop on League, a new champion ""Pyke"" just released!*

*""Cat support? The only cat we have in League is the AD Assassin, Rengar. Yuumi? Who's that? That fall was pretty bad man. You sure you're alright?""*",A6503,12/03/23 09:02:15 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11p0v0o/satire_5_ideas_on_how_to_force_yuumi_to_detach/

Kog's passive should probably take inspiration from other zombie passives like Sion or Karthus and allow Kog'maw to either salvage his lane after getting caught/dyin by being able to catch a wave after dying or to have more impact \[probably CC\]

 Morg's passive could probably be buffed to bring back Morgana jungle without buffing Morg supp, Morg jungle had like a consistent sub 45% WR since durability and in pro play, it was only brought once or twice last season paired with hypercarry ADC so she could blackshield him",Boudynasr,12/03/23 06:53:25 PM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11pbr0i/riots_balance_team_has_started_focusing_on/

leagueoflegends,MVPs should earn slightly more and lose slightly less LP,"
Currently league doesn't reward you for playing well unless you win. And seeing someone you had to drag to victory earn same LP as you feels shitty. Especially if they started trolling and you had to carry a 4v5.

League already had ways to determine MVP of the match. Said person should get like +2 more LP on wins, and lose like 2 less LP on losses.

It doesn't make a big difference, but it'll only incentivize people to make more calculated plays. 

I think Wildrift already does this by granting the MVP fortitude points and eventually you get a loss prevent shield.",tnbeastzy,08/03/23 01:11:12 PM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11ln4an/mvps_should_earn_slightly_more_and_lose_slightly/
leagueoflegends,literally the worst game for new players to (try) and get into,"so like, do i need to play against bots for eternity before i become a god-tier master at the game and understand every single counter to every enemy i come across in any given match, lest i be berated by teammates the entire match?


I understand the core fundamentals of the game and how to play, but im still in the process of learning all the items and figuring out what order to build said items during matches, counters for the most-used heroes, etc. 

i played a couple matches last night and people would be telling the team to report me without explaining what im even doing wrong. 
what really stumps me is that i assume im in a trash elo bracket, yet these dudes are playing with me in the trash bracket and the way they talk it feels like im still in high-elo play. 


is there just no other noobs in this game to play with anymore? im forced to either play against bots for ages and not really learn anything past how my own hero functions, or hop into regular play and get berated every single match by people that i assume havent seen sunlight in about a decade, and cant fathom what its like to be new at the game anymore. 

genuinely asking for advice, do i just power through the people berating me until i get good? seems to be the only real way to learn aside from watching youtube guides for the next 3-5 months.",Spare_Math,08/03/23 07:50:21 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11lfs2d/literally_the_worst_game_for_new_players_to_try/

leagueoflegends,Looking For League Players! (Beginners and Veterans),"Hi, I'm doing a design project for my university class, and my team is trying to design a product/service that enables beginners to deal with harassment in competitive team-based games such as League to promote a healthier community. As such, this process involves both beginners and veterans of the game. 

I'm hoping to at a base level, interview a player and have them play with a prototype design that we've come up with, which should take 30 minutes or so. Then, if possible, it'd be great if I could observe you play one game of League (or other competitive game of your choice) to learn more about the space.

leagueoflegends,I feel like players that play atrociously bad should get double the MMR loss compared to their teammates,"Lately alot of games got won or lost insanely hard and one-sided (d1/master Elo), because of 1-2 special snowflakes in the game not trying at all anymore after a bad game start. It's very obvious that they are soft inting and going 3/15 or something like that and i really wish riot starts to invent a system that literally tells the players ""if u play insanely bad for whatever reason you will lose more MMR than others"" because alot of the time i feel like players get upset after a bad early game then they don't try to play good at all anymore and just run around for fun trying to annoy everybody else because ""they are pissed off"" a system like this would probably drastically reduce behavior from players like i listed above because now it doesn't matter anymore if they would win more Games, because as long as they troll they would lose more MMR resulting even with a positive Winrate, in a drop for MMR and Rank. I heard there are also a bunch of pro players perma griefing whenever they feel like it, and this would also be a sting in their ass for sure.

Btw i am not saying add a system that punishes you by going 0/5 or 3/7 i'm literally saying add a system that punishes you if it's insanely obvious, like 2/15 kind of stats for 20Minutes ingame or 2/20 for 40minutes ingame.

I think it would prevent first-timers (who we all hate), and smurfs because they would need a minimum of games on the champion  on their smurf account to pick it, which makes it annoying for them.

However i think there's some downsides to it : tryhards in normals meaning toxicity, and the need of having more than a few champs on your champion pool (cause bans/picks). 

I think the minimum shouldnt be too high but something like mastery 4. Also being autofilled should disable the limit imo.

I find that now people are not willing to challenge themselves and fight more skilled opponents. If it is a little too hard everyone clicks the surrender button so quickly. I miss those games where we fight to the very end until nexus is destroyed. Sometimes even turning the game around (so fun). I don't care if we lose because I just want to play. Now I keep getting teammates that surrender at 20 mins mark before I even get to start doing something.  What is the point of playing the game if you are going to just surrender at 20 mins.

It seems like just yesterday the first League pros were taking their steps into the new world of esports, but alas those memories are as distant as they are precious. Soon now, the LPL will be marking its 10 years anniversary - and it is sure to be something special of its own. 

Over these 10 years countless dream-seekers have entered the ring to fight for their place at the top, risking their very livelihoods to do what they love. From those who were with us for only a short time, to those who dominated at the top for years on end - they all helped to build the foundations of the league that continues to stand on so many years later.

Each ballot cast will of course contain 10 players - who are yours?

There needs to be some punishment (specially for below diamond games) where ppl are just spamming ff.

For example, I can play J4, Wukong, Evelynn, Sej and Kha'zix well. How do i know which one should i pick if my teammate pick A and B and my opponent pick C and D?

I learn some basic concepts that

1. J4, Wukong are engage champs
2. Eve and Kha'zix fit in poke comps since they are assassins
3. Sej is more like a disengage champ but could also engage sometimes.

However, even with these concepts and so many games, I still couldn't figure out the answer.

Does Riot really think a newer player to this role can handle on these meta shifts.  4 BIG meta shifts in 5 Months.  This role is still the least played and the worse when autofilled.  The best part they did for Jungle this season was make the pet AOE burn camps so champs that had shit clears could keep up with champs that have amazing clears so every jungler can full clear and be level 4 before first crab spawn.  All they had to do was implement this + nerf the Sustain on S12 Jungle and I think Jungle would be decent as S12 jungle had both Highclear champs but as well as Ganking champs.

leagueoflegends,Calling it now: Yuumi will abandon their ADC at level 1 to support the top lane bruiser/tank or the mid lane assassin.,"The new friendship changes to Yuumi will cause her to abandon their ADC at level 1 as opposed to level 6 for relatively few drawbacks. I expect top lane would be the best spot for Yuumi, with mid working only if you have a ranged top laner and an assassin mid. Here is why.

Pros

* Yuumi has an awful laning phase, so leaving her ADC alone doesn't make a huge difference. It probably makes it better overall because the ADC will only feed 300g per kill as opposed to 600.
* Yuumi can make up her awful laning phase by making top or mid lane 2v1.
* Yuumi gets all the benefits that she had with staying with a bruiser before the nerf
* If you are against a melee top lane, you are actually pretty strong as yuumi, as you can harass them in lane early relatively safely
* Riot most likely did not balance the friendship mechanic around you being with a bruiser, so you are likely far stronger with one compared to an ADC


Cons

* The top or mid laner is a bit underlevel, but this is made up for by having an empowered yuumi
* This doesn't work very well if top and mid are both ranged, but then again, why would you pick yuumi with that comp?
* This might make your ADC mad, but as long as they don't rage quit and ideally farm under tower, you will be in a better position overall",AdNausNewMeta,08/03/23 02:08:43 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11l6jp3/calling_it_now_yuumi_will_abandon_their_adc_at/

But anyways every time I fight a Nasus it diesnt ever feel like there's anything i can do to him. Especially if they run fleet footwork all they have to do is just q a minion and run away and repeat that, until they eventually get sheen and just win level 6 cause their ult gives their q zero cooldown and sheen is really strong on auto resets. So I'm not really sure how I'm supposed to combat this, cause I usually play Sett or K'sante and when I'm playing Sett me e'ing him pushes the wave so it ends up putting him in a good spot, and K'sante can't really attack someone without pushing the wave considering all his attacks are aoe.

I understand (as much as one can) the MMR system but why is my MMR so low when my win rate is so high? I win the majority of my games but then have any LP game wiped out by the 25% of games where I get a support without a support item, or just a huge gap elsewhere on the map!

Am I really supposed to be winning 80% of the games to realistically level up? Because that is IMPOSSIBLE in the complete RNG hellhole that is low ELO 😂",kermit_ninja,13/03/23 07:28:51 PM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11q73x2/genuine_question_how_are_you_supposed_to_rank_up/

leagueoflegends,There should be fun while losing a game,"There's nothing worse than a losing game. It's not just losing but the way the game plays out when losing. It's the WAY and not just the loss.

List of things that feel bad when losing:

\-get bullied to oblivion

\-can't get objectives

\-can't even build items to have fun

\-everyone one shots you because enemy is levels ahead

\-bleeding feeling of just waiting to lose the game but team doesn't want to ff

&amp;#x200B;

Consider these things that feel bad. It FEELS bad and it's not just the loss. 

What should be done? Eliminate a few in the list to make a lost game tolerable.

I wish I can build items at least in the game when I'm losing. The enemy is ahead anyway to they'll have more items the entire game. You can't even enjoy the game because you can't build items when losing. Simple change of letting players have faster builds just to have fun at least.

&amp;#x200B;

This feels bad when enemy has 2 full items withc mythic and you have sorcerer boots and a blasting wand. It would be better if something would be done with this.

While Lux's stun can stun 2 entities at a time, Morgana can only stun 1, meaning a creep can block it.

Even though Neeko is a midland I play her as support because her E isn't blocked by creeps and last enough to use my ult, making enough damages to let my adc last hit and take the kill.

shes now at the strongest shes ever been because she can get ie at 2nd item instead which is more beneficial for her overall

seriously, is there any other reason to buff her other than to shake up proplay meta and shift it away from lucian nami and zeri lulu? teasing arcane s2 possibly?

leagueoflegends,We created an ARAM leaderboard," A while back a group of friends and I talked about how awesome it would be to be able to play ARAM's and get it shown in a leaderboard as points in order to see who is a better ARAM player, it turns out we thought of a way of doing that and a few months later we created [rankedaram.gg](https://rankedaram.gg/)

Currently in Alpha version, we aim to show ARAM players their position in a leaderboard. For now, the community is small and only reached our closest friends and few users from the ARAM subreddit as we wanted to test the points system and check that everything is working as intended in the most basic features that the website will include.

Yesterday we released an update that provided the website with new looks, a bright and dark view mode, and also the most important part, **almost all regions are now available!**

Up until yesterday's update, the website was only available for players on EUW, however **now players from NA, KR, EUNE, LAN, LAS, TR, BR, RU, JP &amp; OCE can also sign up!**

Unfortunately, we were not able to add yet the servers from South East Asia but those will come in the future aswell.

We have also added a little panel showcasing what we will be introducing in the future in terms of ranking, which is, besides the monthly ranking, an annual ranking and also an all-time ranking. As you can already tell, monthly ranking is region restricted and so will be the annual ranking, however, the All-Time ranking will NOT be region restricted so everybody that has signed up will be shown there with the full extent of their games.

The website update also comes with new languages, besides Spanish and English, the website is now also available in French, German, Romanian, Catalan, and Galician. We are looking forward to introduce more languages as time goes by, let us know which language you'd like to have the website in!

In the future, we plan on adding match history along with how many points have you gained in a win or a lose plus some cool ways to show statistics, along with data to help you improve your performance when playing ARAM games.

I have seen people on the web regret the fact that they can't check their ARAM MMR anymore, however, we think we provided, somehow, a solution to that problem.

leagueoflegends,The fundamental rule about abiding the law - and how Riot overlooks the most important thing about game-ruining behavior,"If you look at humanity right now, there are many places on many continents where - if the law is not enforced - people behave like animals. It's very sad yet very powerful rule.

&amp;#x200B;

There is no clear comparison to League, because in this game you can have many accounts that are not linked. It's like you can commit robbery and then change your identity/appearance in 10 seconds and go live in another country without your past life being connected to you in any way.

&amp;#x200B;

So whatever punishment you enforce in League, however severe, it doesn't matter because anyone can create another account, and after playing even 50 games on that new account with same IP, same internet provider, with the same desktop setup (that is easily checkable), with the same location (that is easily checkable) - they are still undetectable. In 2023 they are UNDETECTABLE?

&amp;#x200B;

Also, any barriers created, like having to log in to an account with a phone verification (every time you log in) - make it harder to be ""anonymous"" and have many accounts. There will never be a perfect system, but the effort for ""AI"" punishment system is a band-aid that has not been working for years. After a week of having a band-aid on your finger, you would definitely put that worn-off band-aid in the trash. When will the reality of a used band-aid be acknowledged?

&amp;#x200B;

Unless something is done so that punishments are real in the sense that every account of that one person is affected - all anti-game-ruining systems will fail miserably. It will be like all those fines in millions of dollars that punish a company that made 2 bln in profit for breaking that law. It's simple math. Breaking the law is profitable, so companies will do it.",QiyanasStoriesYT,11/03/23 04:39:55 PM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11of0rs/the_fundamental_rule_about_abiding_the_law_and/

leagueoflegends,"LPL PSA: Playoff Lockin', Let's Get Rockin","The race has begun! Already now three teams have locked their spots in the LPL’s 2023 Spring playoffs: EDG, LNG, and JDG. There’s still plenty of talent not yet on this list, and this weekend’s games will be crucial in determining just who can dab those remaining spots.

**IG vs WE, 8:00AM CET Saturday**

Both teams which were overlooked coming into the split, they are definitive candidates to fight for a playoff spot. Although IG has cooled off from a roaring hot start to the year, their roster still has incredibly young talent to look out for - namely their exciting rookie YSKM in the toplane. 

Up against them are a WE which seek to prove themselves, and overturn a damaged reputation for the organization after terrible performances in recent memory. And with budding stars like Shanks on the team, they can almost certainly do just that.

**RNG vs WBG, 12:00PM CET Saturday**

If someone had told us a few months ago that Royal Never Give Up would be on the verge of losing their playoff spot in Week 8, we would’ve laughed you to the moon. Now, it is no joke.

After an uncharacteristically dreadful start to the year, RNG now sit at 5-7, teetering on the brink of dropping to out of playoff range. With Ming and Angel both now on the starting roster their outlook should improve, but will it be enough? They’re up this Saturday against a WBG roster that has shown itself to be solid, even if somewhat inconsistent. If Weibo can hit their high this weekend, then it’s do or die for RNG.

**LNG vs JDG, 12:00PM CET Sunday**

Even after posting a 9-2 scoreline, LNG has many detractors. Amid accusations of being fraudsters and having weak team balance, they took down TES earlier this week - silencing many of the doubters. Now, they once again have a chance to prove that they deserve their title as a top contender. 

JD Gaming on the flipside were heralded by many around the world as an unstoppable juggernaut, even before they had played their first game. One could be forgiven for thinking such with a roster of 369, Kanavi, knight, Ruler, and Missing, but in reality they are riding into a third place - behind their upcoming opponents. Last week they suffered a devastating upset at the hands of OMG, and now are looking for a rebound.

So who will win out? Another LPL question that needs to be settled in none other than a battle on the rift…

leagueoflegends,Increasing dodge punishment is wrong.,"As title says , dodging right lobbies enabled me to climb elo. Many times I get either 3 adcs, or 3 aps in my team. Or it’s Shaco and Teemo. People will pick a champion first time and dgf about the draft composition. So basically people that know what kind of good team comp looks like are punished because they are the ones who are likely to dodge. Not the ones who picked what they think it’s good for them not for the team. This change was suppose to be -1 and then -3 and then -5LP btw. I like dodging , because if I lose the game that I will play , I have at least confidence that draft was good , but x players fed or myself perhaps.",Foxeex,08/03/23 07:58:21 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11lfz5g/increasing_dodge_punishment_is_wrong/

leagueoflegends,Is there any use for Azir?,"I have tried to find a use for Azir but I just fail to find it, as support he falls behind compared to other more useful picks, hes only good at poking but his q's slow even, the only ability that could be useful in any way on the support role, is so weak it could even stop existing and hardly anyone would notice; on mid the only option is to play extremely defensive for 12 minutes, but if your opponent has high mobility or has any means of somehow reaching you very quickly by dashing for example, or hes an assassin like diana, then might as well go afk; I even desperately tried it on jungle but his clear time is depressing and he can't 1v1 the blue buff at lvl 3 after doing the other camps near red buff first.

&amp;#x200B;

I definitely am not a prodigy but isn't it a little bit ridiculous that its that hard to find a use for a champ while there are other champions that are stupidly easy and useful in all positions almost? 

If I were to make a list of champions that are more than awesome on more than 1 lane it would take over 50% of the actual champions for sure, and many more, but Azir instead he falls short on all positions. 

I acknowledge that Azir has some somewhat decent scaling, but what I mean is early game, lane phase for example, it's not about waiting 6 minutes to see some gameplay for him, but its literally waiting mid game and endgame to let Azir have an impact on the game other than knocking enemies here and there with his r (usually towards the turret because without it Azir is literally hopeless for the first 20 minutes of the game)

&amp;#x200B;

So my question is, is Azir a champion destined to be forgotten? He's definitely fun to play because of his dashes and the mobility they provide, even if his E has a cooldown so long, also his R, which I can't explain, but still.",ItSAgaInStthEruLeS1,13/03/23 03:17:01 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11pn2i0/is_there_any_use_for_azir/

leagueoflegends,LP system changes,"In a nutshell, I have had **a roughly 70-75% winrate over the past 25 games** \- consisting of an 8 game winstreak and another 6 game winstreak.

I went from **G4 to G1 over that span**. I only gained **20-24 LP per win**. I hit G1, lost two games and then demoted to G2. I then lost one more game and got **-25LP for the loss**?

Why such a large loss in LP when I've only gained 20-24 LP per win (with winstreaks too) and have a relatively high winrate? This makes no sense at all - especially when in the lost games, I had decent farm, damage and KP %.

leagueoflegends,An issue with new MMR system," Hello guys. I want to share my issue with everyone and ask does someone get into the same situation too? Recently I got to D3 with 60% WR. I'm not some kind of a smurf and my average elo was around high plat-low diamond, just got lucky I guess. But after that I got a big losestreak ( Went 7-13 in last 20 games). A common situation, we win some we lose some. But after I dropped to P1 85 LP I noticed that I literally start getting +10 to +12, but if I lose I get -26 to -29. What is this? I know that my MMR dropped, but no way there will be such a huge difference between LP when I win and when I lose. Riot said they changed LP gain in one of their latest post. I hope that it is an error because if this ""works as intended"" then firstly it is very bad system secondly my account is literally ruined because to continue to climb I'll have to have 80+% WR or smth, which is unfeasible even for a lot of smurfs",ExoticUniversity8220,07/03/23 11:39:05 PM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11l2kp1/an_issue_with_new_mmr_system/

leagueoflegends,Full-in ping is not effective compared to OMW ping,"I have noticed that when I want my team to fight and use the new full-in ping (the one with the two yellow crossing swords), it feels like they react not as good as when I use the OMW ping. Maybe there is some conditioning that players are not yet used to it, but I have to admit that it is not loud enough / the sound may not provoke the right response in most players.

While we are at it it's same as the danger ping (red attention mark) and retreat ping (yellow and loud) where the second provides a more instant reaction from teammates because it is extremely loud.

And finally, we can talk about amount of pings necessary for a response. I believe 2-3 pings is the ideal spot for an effective communication and the less dynamic the game is the less need for intense pinging, but this may seem intuitive to most.

Upon death, Haydn loses 25% of his current Spectral Waltz stacks.

Q: Inner Cue
Active: Haydn waves his baton at an Ally, granting them 20% movement speed and 10/15/20/25/30 Attack Damage for 5 seconds.

E: Stage Fright
Active: Haydn hides in the shadows becoming invulnerable for up to 0.6/0.7/0.8/0.9/1 second.
Recast: Haydn returns at a nearby target location summoning a stage underneath himself. Enemies under the area are knocked up for 0.5 seconds and are feared for 0.5 second upon landing.

R: Inner Viennese

At the beginning of the cast, Ra’Za grants himself a 70/90/110 (+150% AD) shield for 2.5 seconds, granting himself crowd control immunity while the shield holds.
- If Void Call successfully slows an enemy, Void Rush’s channel duration is reduced to 1 second for 4 seconds. If an enemy champion is knocked up by Void Call, Void Rush’s channel duration is reduced to 0 seconds for 4 seconds.

leagueoflegends,Thoughts on Playing Milio in PBE so far,"Really tough trying to get a game of Milio. But managed to get 2 games of him so far. 

---

**Q** 

His Q feels amazing. It's fast and long ranged. The damage is actually really good. Didn't notice how big the knockback range was until I hit a minion with Q. 

Got a lot of sneaky Q's on the enemy with hitting minions. 

It's like a longer range Karma Q. Which is nuts. 

---

**W** 

You have to be so conservative with this ability. When we had it up in laning phase, it was like a ""We Win The Trade"" button. 

When the skill was on cooldown, I felt so weak. Lost every trade. Which is good imo. 

---

**E** 

Good skill expression. Casting E gives the passive auto attack damage boost. Smacked the ADCs with empowered auto attacks that hit like a truck. 

Imagine if Karma could speed herself up twice and get 2 sheen auto attacks. 

--- 

**R**

Super long cooldown. Have to be super conservative with pressing it. 

Didn't feel the impact of it personally, since I was up against a poke comp. Jayce and Corki. 

Milio really is bad against poke. It felt horrible going up against it. His W doesn't heal much and his shields are very minor until later. 

--- 

It feels like he plays like a Karma in laning phase. You have to play around his W cooldown. In-between his W cooldown, he tries to poke you with Q.

leagueoflegends,Do you think T1 streaming on afreecatv is good for them?,"I'm having a discussion with a friend right now. Just to let you know we are both not at all big T1 or any League team fans but we are just semi interested in the subject.

I personally really don't like the way afreecatv works. The platform is terribly laggy and 2-3/5 times the stream i want to watch doesn't even start.

All of T1 players stream there nowadays.

Probably they made a contract and got a lot of money from them for being there for a while exclusively. Fine. 

The question is; do you think it is a good decision finacially and for reachability long term for T1 ?

I feel like if they were just active on Twitch they would reach way more people, would build a more robust viewerbase and much more. I'm not a fan of amazon, i don't have prime. I don't want only 1 platform to succeed and im pretty neutreal toward this whole topic.

I was just thinking in terms of business, it can't be good for T1, the players nor the viewerbase because it pretty much limits it to Korea only at the moment.

Whats your opinion? What do you think is behind the deal except it just them getting a lot of money to stream on an inferior platform?

leagueoflegends,Why is the MMR system still bad?,"You cannot rationally have an MMR system that only counts winning or losing in a team 5v5 game.

&amp;#x200B;

Chess is a 1v1 game, and where MMR originated. You win, you go up. You lose, you lose rating points, you go down. It makes sense.. in chess. But even in chess performance is applied.. if you beat a higher rated opponent, you get a few more points.

&amp;#x200B;

In LoL, how can this be applied? You need to add small factors for performance which don't exist, and this is a problem. It just doesn't make sense. In LoL mmr seems just fixed on win/loss, with hardly any other factor at play and that's absurd considering how much ""team based"" this game can be.

&amp;#x200B;

If someone goes 10-0 and loses because the rest of the team was having a bad one or someone AFKd/tilted/started running it down or they suddenly just FF without your willingness, does it make sense that all should lose the same amount of LP?

leagueoflegends,My path to fourth place in Tier 4 Clash,"This humble tale starts on a warm and humid evening at 8:07 PM when our top laner informs us he will not be able to partake in Clash. We rush to find a replacement, wait in queue for less time than expected, and meet our first opponent by 8:40.

A moment of hesitation hits us all as a team consisitng of 1 70% WR diamond2 player, 2 silver players, 1 bronze and 1 iron player faces us. All five of the enemy players attempt to add our teammate with the most feminine name. ""Hi uwu im going to be cheating so my friends can win sry in advance.. :3"". Our midlaner's PC crashes 10 mins in and we unsurprisingly shit stomp the enemy team.

Our midlaner's PC determined that the league of legends client used too many resources and would not launch for the rest of the night. While we arrange for someone else to take our midlaner's account and play on a working computer, our top laner and first pick does not load into champ select for the second game due to another client error. We ban 0 champions and recieve a random champion, gangplank. Our first pick begins to restart his client. The enemy team picks their onetricks, our replacement for our midlaner has still not logged in.

Our second pick is another random champion. Annie. Our yorick one trick pony logs in and states that he can in fact first time Annie in our clash game. We lose to the enemy's unbanned onetricks by narrow margins, unlucky. Queue silver scrapes we are going to our final game. 

The third game comes, no funny business, we get to pick AND ban in champ select, our plat1 toplaner playing on our midlaner's account gets his yorick one trick as our enemies dont expect it. He solo loses to a silver player. Oopsies! The loading screen tip informing my top laner that Jax’s favorite food is eggs was not enough to contribute to successfully counter playing the recently reworked champion. What started as an exciting evening looking forward the revival of clash turns into a stunning success with few mishaps that may be improved on in the future. How were y’all’s first clashes of season 2023? 

Overall, I would like to thank my mom and my dad, as well as riot for allowing me to achieve such a prestigious award- fourth place in tier 4 clash. As for future aspirations, I hope to perform on the worlds stage next and I hope that my team will be able to pick or ban more effectively in the future. 

On a more serious note, why does the league of legends client take up more resources than rust, minecraft, and the actual game running all at the same time?",BigBrainBuffoon,12/03/23 01:32:25 PM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11p6ewv/my_path_to_fourth_place_in_tier_4_clash/
leagueoflegends,Is there a champion based on a capybara?,Serious question. Is there one? If not I need one as a support champion. Q = charm effect. W = put the ADC on its back to increase the speed to evade enemies plus barrier for a few seconds. E = can place yuzu as temporary wards which is also a trap.

leagueoflegends,Climbing out of Iron,"I started playing league a couple of months ago - in January. I played mostly ADC until I hit level 30, and I ended up in Iron 4. 

If you’re stuck like I was, I recommend playing jungle. I switched from ADC to jungle a couple days ago, and I immediately got promoted to Iron 2 with a 100% win rate. 

I know it’s weird for an Iron player to give advice - but I feel like I probably understand what games are like in Iron, more than the other players on this sub. 

Pick a jungle champ you like, and try to focus on helping your laners snowball, instead of farming all game. It’s much easier to win games if you help your laners gain a lead.

Again, I’m a bad player - but if you’re stuck, you might want to try a different position. Have fun!

leagueoflegends,It's been 10 months since the durability patch and lethality builds are still inefficient. Maybe it's time to revert it back to flat armor penetration?,"As the title states, lethality builds have been incredibly inefficient since the durability patch. Mathematically, the purpose of lethality and flat penetration in general is to reduce your enemies resistances to \~0, something that lethality builds haven't been able to achieve in a very long time even against targets that build no additional armor.

&amp;#x200B;

This kinda shoves assassins into building Serylda's Grudge 3rd every game because its BiS in 95% of games, even though it's not really something that you want to build as an assassin. I would much rather play around my dirk powerspikes (i.e dirk, mythic + dirk, mythic + youmuus + dirk) which is not really possible in this day and age because if I keep building lethality after 3rd item then I'm kinda losing to the shopkeeper.

&amp;#x200B;

The simple solution is to make lethality fully flat at all levels.

How it works currently is, if I buy [Prowler's Claw](https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Prowler's_Claw) at level 8, I don't actually get **18** lethality as the item states, and I instead get **14** lethality. It is very bizarre that it still works this way, when the lethality system was introduced at a time where flat armor pen builds were overbearing, and it made sense back then. Not to mention that, of course, the new system can be very misleading for newer players.

leagueoflegends,Support looking for advice to get out of iron 3-4 seasons in a row,"Hello all! Before you read - I don't want to hear ""just play a different role"". That is not an option due to some factors.

I'm a hard-stuck iron-bronze support. Started off playing Janna, soon enough understood that aint gonna cut it. So I moved to Brand and Morgana. I'd say those 3 are my mains, based on the opponents and availability ( e.g. I will always play Morgana into Thresh or Veigar, or Brand when our team has enough shields and other team has nothing I should shield from, but we need that extra passive damage. And Janna is just useless in my ELO). I am decent at some other champs, but not to the point of freely playing them in ranked. I 'd like to think that I have 1 purely healer/shielder, one purely attack and 1 that is a bit of everything.

I 've been told by some plat players that I don't deserve to be where I am ( which has gotten to my head a lot :D ). I ward like mad, I've been told my map awareness is extremely good given my rank. Hell, I can carry a weak ADC to win the lane, if I have to. There are games where my split-pushing and wave-clearing wins us the game, simply becaues I know the other team can't group if they have to defend 3 lanes at once. But mu teams tend to think I'm just a bad support, because supposedly all I should do is ward and shield them blindly.

I've been putting off doing ranked this season as I see no point in it anymore. All I do is get frustrated. I play only solo queue ( no friends :D) or flex, also queue alone.

leagueoflegends,"Why is Vi considered a good counter to Zeri, especially in pro play?","According to lolalytics soloqueue data, over the last 30 days in Plat+, Zeri is one of Vi's worst ADC matchups, with a -1.82 normalized delta. The three worst (Xayah, Sivir, Zeri in that order) are all around -2, while the next worst is -0.38, so it seems like these three ADCs are by far the best counters to Vi within the role. Zeri's delta around -2 is consistent among higher brackets like D2+, on smaller sample sizes.

In pro play, Vi is often cited as a good pick into Zeri since Vi can press R to get guaranteed CC on Zeri, which is difficult otherwise. Do we think the coordinated teams in pro play are *that* much better at 1-shotting Zeri during 1.3 seconds of Vi ult, even through more coordinated peel like from a professional Lulu? Are soloqueue players that bad at using/following up on Vi ult? Or could this just be a mistaken claim?

Edit: I guess I'm just trying to understand why there would be such a huge discrepancy between soloqueue, even high skill brackets, and pro play. It's hard for me to just believe that Vi vs. Zeri goes from Vi being the counter to Zeri being the counter.",aladytest,11/03/23 03:05:49 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11nxrnu/why_is_vi_considered_a_good_counter_to_zeri/

leagueoflegends,This is how CBLoL stands looks with one week left in the regular stage.,"&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/yjopugrqzdna1.png?width=314&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=d339fcdfe379e6638643c2b164f4223a48bbb485

Well... A few weeks ago I posted here that CBLoL was the most balanced league in the world. But, it turned out that all big organizations will qualify for the playoffs. We won't have any surprises.

Only the last spot is open, and the matches of these teams **(Furia, INTZ and KaBuM!)** are:

* **INTZ** plays against **Fluxo** and **Vivo KeyD**
* **FURIA** plays against **Red Canids** and **Los Grandes**
* **KaBuM!** plays against **Vivo KeyD** and **paiN Gaming**

The point is that Vivo KeyD, despite being in last place, **is a team that can easily beat INTZ and KaBuM! right now. They almost made a miracle run after the roster changes.**

So yeah, nothing is set in stone, but the tendency is for FURIA to qualify with 7 wins.

**Another observation:** There has never been a team in CBLoL that finished the regular stage in first place and became champions in playoffs, and Los Grandes, despite being in first place, is already showing signs of decline, especially from HiRiT and Lava.

So yes, currently the biggest bets are for a repeat between **paiN Gaming** and **LOUD**. Both teams faced a slump during the regular phase, but they are just like old Fnatic, G2 or TSM. No matter the regular stage, they will always make finals.

**Top 3 players in each role right now:**

* **Top: Wizer** (Import - paiN Gaming), **Boal** (Red Canids) and **HiRit** (Import - Los Grandes)
* **Jungle: Aegis** (Red Canids), **Ranger** (Los Grandes) and **Grell** (Import - Vivo Keyd)
* **Mid: Dynquedo** (paiN Gaming), **Tinowns** (LOUD) and **Hauz** (Fluxo)
* **Bot: Netuno** (Los Grandes), **Bvoy** (Import - paiN Gaming), **Titan** (Red Canids) and **Brance** (Fluxo)

*\* ADC is the best role in the CBLoL by far. Netuno, Brance and TitaN would play well in a major region for sure. So yeah, it's a top 4.*

* **Support: Zay** (Los Grandes), **Jojo** (Fluxo) and **Ceos** (LOUD)

**Trivia**

* **Tinowns** and **Dynquedo** are midlaners that have improved a lot and have become top 2 in Brazil thanks to **Xero**, the Korean coach from **paiN Gaming**. He is famous for doing a great job with midlaners. Tinowns played in paiN gaming from 2017 until 2021. Xero is the paiN Gaming head coach since 2019.
* **Lava** and **HiRiT** ***arrived in Brazil as the biggest imports ever***, but individually they are suffering a lot in CBLoL and Los Grandes' botlane (Netuno, 20, and Zay, 17) is saving the team.
* **Red Canids** is **TitaN**'s team, probably the best player mechanically in Brazil today. Besides being very good mechanically, he is a good shotcaller. The team is struggling because they had to use the Academy's support **(scamber)** and the midlane **(Avenger)** is in a very bad moment.
* **Wizer** (paiN Gaming) is ***one split away from gaining residency*** in the CBLoL. He will be the first Korean to achieve this in Brazil if he stays here.
* Toplaners in Brazil, for the most part, ***don't know how to play weak side***. **Wizer**, **HiRit**, **Boal** (top 3) are only playing with carrys. **Robo** (LOUD) and **Guigo** (Vivo KeyD) ***are exceptions.***
* On the other hand, ***midlaners here like to play the map***. ***So roaming midlaners make success around here***. Tinowns, for example, is famous for being dominant with TF and Taliyah.
* The biggest problem in CBLoL are the supports. ***Our support pool is weak***, although good names have been appearing recently: **Zay** (Los Grandes), **Ayu** (FURIA), **scamber** (Red Canids) and **Guigs** (KaBum!)",Dsalgueiro,13/03/23 07:32:05 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11ptjtf/this_is_how_cblol_stands_looks_with_one_week_left/

Hi guys! Just wanted to let you know I've been maining Teemo Support for a good while now. I've seriously played it every day for over a year + and more before that even.

Here are the current events. Last season we ended in d4 promos as peak. This season as of today we are plat 2. I've made it my goal to reach high diamond this season playing almost only Teemo Support.

So far with 100 ish games I am 61% overall and 63% Teemo Support. I'd like to share my knowledge and thoughts with you all. Please let me know what you guys think of my updated sheet. 

Sadmo OUT!

Let me know what you guys think!

Answer the Poll, Is Teemo Support Based?

leagueoflegends,Why can champions use both Cleaver and another Pen Item?,"Basically what the title says. It's a little annoying that champions, and bruisers in particular can itemize both Seryldas/Lord Dom/Mortal Reminder while also being able to buy Cleaver. I've only really seen Aatrox do this combo, especially if you've seen Naayil's builds recently. However, I believe this is also viable on other bruisers like Riven.",Thrumbo42,08/03/23 10:02:21 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11lixmu/why_can_champions_use_both_cleaver_and_another/

leagueoflegends,How to fix Yuumi," When Yuumi attackes to a champ she stores their QWER as hers QWER. And when she moves to the next champ she can still use the QWER of the previous champ. To make it clear Yuumi is using the abilities she copies from champs she atteches to. 

 So you attach to Kassadin get his R then you go on Nasus and give Kassadin's ult. Or you get Malphite R and then go on Yasuo for 1.5 man wombo combo. It will be broken as hell but at least it will be more fun than the current Yuumi. This way she can become even more cancer for everyone in the game. You take Hecarim ult and just as your teammate is about to pop off you ult them out.  

If you want to ""balance"" the monstrosity I just created you can make her abilities very weak so she has very high skill cap. Only if you are good at Yuumi and know how to use everyone's abilities you can pop off and carry a fight. But that way she will be the worst champ to play with. Just as your Darius is about to ult 5 times and get a penta you turn him into a spider with Elise's ult. 

There's just no way a champ like this won't be loved by the community",KATAR1N4,12/03/23 07:04:21 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11oy1j2/how_to_fix_yuumi/
