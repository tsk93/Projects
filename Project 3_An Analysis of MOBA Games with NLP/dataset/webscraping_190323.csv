From him spamming his laser to blind us so I cannot auto him in lane, to him having blink incredibly early and just spamming it to prevent me from disabling or interrupting his reload and so on.

Is he a strong pick in general right now? Or is there something I don't know?

I tried OD, I tried Silencer against him. He always manages to somehow beat my lane, or if I am close to killing him he just tps back to fountain and comes back full HP again.",gospodishere,14/03/23 12:57:11 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/11qf0y8/how_to_deal_with_tinker/

I reinstalled the game about 20 minutes ago because I’m an addict, but seriously dude.

Rearm shouldn’t let Tinker instantly Blink away if he’s actively being attacked or taking damage while casting it. Every other hero in the game has to pay attention to positioning and be careful about taking damage around blink or avoiding damage to be able to blink away, tinker can eat a 3s stun, rearm while tank autos and waving, and then just repeatedly blink away for free with no counter play available whatsoever or need to think about positioning in any way.",ApprehensiveAd3778,17/03/23 02:20:33 PM,https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/11tj1v7/playing_against_tinker_lastnight_made_me_ragequit/

DotA2,Aeon Disk or Heart as 3rd item on mage?,"Hello.

For those drawn out games where a mage has already gotten octarine core and scythe of vyse (aghnim's sceptor not needed), realistically there would only be enough gold for 1 extra item before the game ends. To boost survivability lategame, which item is the better choice? On Dota buff, heart has a much higher win rate, but I am very skeptical since it may only be because it's more expensive (so getting one means your team is most likely richer).

&amp;#x200B;

Or, should we get aeon disk as the 2nd item as it is cheaper?

DotA2,Pro players playing Timbersaw in pro matches,"I do not understand what these offlane pro players train of thought while picking timbersaw (in every region except EUW) . Most of the time they blindly  picking whirling death on level 1 just becasue they see a strength carry like someone playing dota for the 1st time and either die or burn all regeneration consumables for the team in under 2 minutes and forced to pick timber chain at level 2  . Now he cannot lane till he reach level 4. Is it hard to understand you pick whirling death only according to the state of the lane? Can you atleast save the skill point till you reach the creep wave?. Why are you even picking timbersaw if you cannot understand the basics of that hero.

DotA2,There is NO punishment for toxic behavior.,"Hey all,

&amp;#x200B;

I've been running an experiment for about 6 months now, I've been quite literally as toxic as possible, every opportunity I get. There just doesn't seem to be any punishment mechanism.

&amp;#x200B;

some stats;

\~ 1000 games played, 100% of them I say the N word.

player score sits between 10k-8k, the lowest it got was 7545 but I kept on truckin' and it rose back up to 9k.

I normally play in a 3-4 stack, so we generally have one or more randoms in our party. EVERY single game I blame the rand for the loss, or ask if we have an (insert hero they are playing\_ in the game, as we win.

I say ezgg N \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ R every win or loss

I go on some pretty wild anti-chinese or indian rants

I ask opposing 3/4/5 stacks if they're playing from offshore detention (an Aussie joke for those playing at home, we like putting immigrants in detention on islands)

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, Dota is super toxic if you try, and there is no real reason to not be toxic, as there is no punishment, as HARD as I try.

What were some of the things that stand out?

I understand principles, and i dont want like ""he won the lane"" even though thats obvious.

Im hoping to extract little details, and tips and tricks to add to my tool belt, to try to become the best (support) player i can be!

Im really just curious, as someone who hasnt played much core at all, what really makes a big difference for yall. In the lane, mid game, and extremely late.

I hope this makes sense and we can have good discussion about it.

DotA2,What game was this?,"I remember a game in either 2021 or 2022, though I am leaning strongly towards 2022. I believe it was in a major or TI. The team in question had something like a 3% chance to win, I believe it was a European team, leaning towards Secret/Liquid/OG/Spirit

They had a particular fight at the Dire Ancients with something like a 30k gold disadvantage, close to the steps leading down to the river. I think they were on Dire. Their carry was Morphling. They won the fight and ended up winning the game.

I have a slight feeling that I disliked the team that lost, so it brought me a lot of joy, hence I am leaning towards VP/Outsiders/EG/LGD.

DotA2,I have been stuck in 1500-3000 behavior for the last 3 months.,"I have been stuck in 1500-3000 behavior for the last 3 months.

My rank is Archon, the scenario is this: some months ago (5-6) in my location there were some outages, which occurred without warning (later it was known that it was an overheating in the lines), anyway, since then I have not been able to increase my behavior for anything in the world. I have tried with rankeds, only support, it is the worst thing that can exist, it is an endless circle of toxicity where no one wants to play roles and everyone wants to be the Carry, there is no cooperation or desire to win as long as you fuck the game to the partner who picked Io mid lane.

What leads me to deal with Turbo, I have been playing with a diversity of heroes which I consider that I have mastered at medium level, Dark Willow and Arc Warden are the ones I play the most, I have an average of 30 kills per game, but apparently that is also harmful, because I end up reported by communications by the enemy team, I came to this conclusion because yesterday I had 3100 of behavior (I don't use the microphone, I don't write, I don't flame) and in spite of that, today when I receive the behavior, I can't talk for 48 hours, and on top of that, my behavior dropped to 1700.

That's so dumb I have no idea how it could be possible. I mean it: it lags hard at 1280x720 resolution with every option disabled and the lowest screen render quality.

DotA2,What i wish for skills change on the next huge update,"On the next huge update, the skywrath arcana will be released and that update will be called the caster update (coping). They will add a bunch of side effect to some spammable skills like.... 

Hammer of purity (omniknight)
After 3 cast on the same target the next cast of hammer of purity added dispel effect to himself and targetted enemies. (I mean... his name is purist. More dispel goes along right?) 

Enchant totem (earthshaker)
After 9 cast, the next cast enchant totem added stun for 0.1 sec effect. (His skill is full of stun, why not add more) 

Mana burn (nyx)
After 5 cast, the next mana burn added half value of burned mana to nyx. (""with abilities which shaped him for one thing and one thing only: to kill in the name of his goddess"" thats on nyx lore. More mana = more skill spam = more kill i guess) 

Call down (gyrocopter)
After 2 cast, the next cast calldown cast range becames global (boom booom boom) 

Mana drain (lion)
After 12 cast, the next mana drain not count as channeling and lion can move with mana drain active but lion movement speed are halved. (Dance lion danceeeeee) 

Scream of pain (QoP)
After 5 cast, the next scream of pain will charm the opponent for 1.3 sec. Charm works like taunt but they will dissarmed. (Gimme moreeeee) 

Arcane bolt (skywrath mage)
Theres a 10/14/18/22% chance to cast another arcane bolt to the target after arcane bolt hit the target (bolts go brrrrr) 

Dual breath (jakiro) (secondary aghs upgrade)
When casting dual breath therea a 3/6/9/12% chance instead of casting dual breath jakiro will cast ice path + macropyre in a cone shape but their duration is 5 sec. (Freak dragon aye pyrexae's kin?)

DotA2,Scythe of Vyse on Drow Ranger?,"What do you guys think of this build? It’s not the 1st item to get though.

&amp;nbsp;

I tested it on a game against AI and it turned out okay. Here’s how I did it:

&amp;nbsp;

**Starting Items**

So for the start of the game, I bought a Ring of regeneration and 5 Ironwood branches. Then I went mid.

&amp;nbsp;

**Early Game**

I bought a Gloves of haste, then rush to upgrade it to Hand of Midas. After that, I went for a Mask of death followed by a Boots of speed.

&amp;nbsp;

**Mid Game**

With the help of the Hand of Midas, I just continued to farm. For mobility reasons, I got Lothar’s edge. (Shadow blade)

The next item that I bought is an Ultimate orb, then a Void stone and Mystic staff. Now the Scythe of Vyse is complete.

After that, I went for a Linken’s sphere. (I was considering getting a BKB, but I went for the Linken’s for the HP regen)

&amp;nbsp;

**Late Game**

Now on this stage, the next thing is to upgrade the Mask of death into Satanic.

Then after that, upgrade the Boots of speed into Boots of Travel.

At this part of the game, I was thinking of replacing the Hand of Midas with either a Manta Style, Butterfly or Buriza-do-Kyanon (Daedalus). I wasn’t able to buy it since the game ended at this part, but I have around 5k gold available.

&amp;nbsp;

So what do you guys think of this?

&amp;nbsp;

In the past, I would always go for damage items, but this time I tried a different build which can be more useful in team fights.

&amp;nbsp;

**P.S.** I don’t have DotA 2 in my laptop right now, so I just tried it out in the Warcraft 3 version (6.81 AI). Here’s a screenshot of the endgame - https://imgur.com/QFr8Q44",RedNovaDay,18/03/23 10:11:52 PM,https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/11upjx8/scythe_of_vyse_on_drow_ranger/

DotA2,"Ever wondered why your Overwatch case for Scripting has 10x as many markers as your Griefing cases (and is incredibly accurate)? It's VACnet, and here's how it works:","If you would like the long version of this, please watch [this](https://youtu.be/kTiP0zKF9bc) talk by Valve employee John Mcdonald about VACnet and it's implementation into CS:GO.

For people who don't have an hour to spare, here's the deal. Valve has determined that deep learning can be used to generate a model that can identify cheaters by watching replays. They train this model using the data from Overwatch cases, because human beings are usually pretty good at determining what looks suspicious when watching a replay. They then run the model on all matches, and when it identifies behaviour that *would* look suspicious to an Overwatch reviewer, VACnet submits that behaviour as an Overwatch case. 

So when you open Overwatch and see that it's a Tinker player reporting for Scripting, and there are 40 markers in the replay, VACnet has identified that at those points there was something suspicious. This can be as simple as a mouse moving at an abnormal speed, skills pressed in an abnormal way, or any number of innocuous things that belie the cheat. You as a Juror are still required to review the evidence, as no model is perfect and VACnet *can* make mistakes, but John in the GDC talk says that VACnet cases for CS GO after a retraining of the model can hit above a 90% conviction rate. 

Lastly, why does us knowing this not allow cheaters to work around it? The answer to this is that the things VACnet checks for to see if someone is cheating are arbitrarily chosen, and changed regularly. John says in the talk they have plans to retrain VACnet every single day, and so when cheaters change their behaviour in response to it catching them out, there is a very small window until the model is able to catch them again. 

I hope this was informative and clears up any confusion around why you might be seeing this in your Overwatch cases. If you are curious further, or don't understand, I recommend watching the talk from John, it is fascinating!",itspaddyd,14/03/23 05:03:29 PM,https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/11r17sh/ever_wondered_why_your_overwatch_case_for/

2). No auto selection, only manual selection of target followed by dragging vector and release to shoot.

DotA2,Another way to play Muerta,"I'm 5-1 on this hero (ranked only). I know I don't have much games, but I already feel the hero is op. I see people playing this hero mainly as carry bc of her 3rd skill + ult. But you can counter her by simply building a bkb. It would be the first carry in dota who is useless against bkb.

&amp;#x200B;

**The way I play**

Offlane (maybe supp 4). Her main skill is the 2nd skill, not the first, not the third. The slow + silence gives you kills and make you survive in lane. You can think as a budget mars ult: the guy have to fight you or run, but will take the damage + silence and die anyway. Of course you can just force him out and trigger the silence with the 1st skill, which can be useful to catch some dodgy heroes.

&amp;#x200B;

**Skills + Talents**

I upgrade the 2nd fully, then the 1st fully. Very rarely when I can't gank much I will get the 2/3 points in the 1st skill and start upgrading the 3rd. I avoid talents to buff the 1st kill, I get buffs for the 2nd and damage.

&amp;#x200B;

**General playstyle**

In the offlane the 1st skill is very usefull to escape incoming ganks or get the last hit in a ranged creep + harass the carry. If you can hit the support when he is coming to gank, you can probably outfarm the carry bc her damage and range are very high. The 2nd skill also can be used to escape if necessary, but it's more interesting to kill + harass.

*At mid game* you go hunt supports. With good position you can solo them,also easily run from ganks with you skills + ult. Don't be shy of using your ult as a ghost scepter, her ult is not that strong until later. *At late game* you can finally transition to a carry + utility, only at 30-40+ you can jump and kill 2-3 heroes. Do not get too fancy with her ulti + 3rd skill, it's mainly used to give some small boost in damage to finalize a hero, most of the time the others just run/don't care.

&amp;#x200B;

**Items build**

Not yet sure what is good, but im going in two ways:

1- 2x null talismans + treads + dagger + witch blade/bkb + revenant's brooch

You should avoid doing bkb and just user your skills (ult included) to escape + dagger, but if the team have too much aoe you will need bkb.

2- drums rush -&gt; boots of bearing + witch blade/bkb + revenant's brooch

This one trades a bit of mobility of the dagger for attack speed + movement speed. Could have more mana problems.

  
This is an int hero, do not be shy of doing vyse or other utility items. Bloodstone, eternal shroud, difussal, kayayasha are viable too. In the super late game you can finally transition to carry and maybe build more damage. You do not need maelstorm to flash farm, you just need mana. You can farm 2 camps at once with your first 3 skills. Spam your skills on creeps, you're an INT HERO.",renand3z,16/03/23 04:17:38 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/11s7xq3/another_way_to_play_muerta/

DotA2,Muerta is a great Position 4,"I have played with Muerta players, and I have played with her myself. And a trend I see is that if you play her as a Position 1, then you have lost the game. Even mid often does great until enemies get Bkb, and then they become useless 9 times out of 10. While her ult is great for survivability, it seems wasted on a core Position right now.

As a support, you are also able to get items like Arcane Boots, which allow you to spam her abilities. And when you get cast range items, her abilities become way more useful.  

Deadshot allows you to use fear on high damage heroes for 2 seconds every 10 seconds. Since fear make enemies unable to be slowed, this makes enemies get away from fights a decent distance, that, without a movement ability, can take them out of fights for 4 seconds or so to get walk back. You can even get enemies out position by bouncing the skill on creeps, trees, or other heroes.

Her W is great at zoning out people or keeping them disabled. You place it down and if the enemy is inside, they are slowed. If they try to get out of it, they get silenced. And if they are out of it, they don't want to go inside because they get silenced and slowed. Overall, a nightmare to deal with early game, and annoying late game. It is like a worse Disruptor ult, but with a third of the cool down.

Midgame, the level 15 talent makes your deadshot shoot from half the map away. This allows you to split push safely, since you can aim trees and direct the projectile while hidden. And at level 20, when you get the second Deadshot, you can split push faster and help more in fights. 

Her playstyle feels a bit like Hoodwink's, just that you are way less mobile, but with more range with your abilities. And even then, you get a Force Staff, a Blink, or a Glimmer Cape, and you are suddenly a nightmare to catch.

While her ult and E don't add much from the support position, the built-in ghost scepter does save her having to buy it to survive. This is 1500 gold that supports have to spend often in mid game, that she doesn't. It allows her to get other items that help her team faster than other supports. It also allows her to right click physical damage carries, something a support is almost never able to do safely.

Her E, which is arguably her worst skill as a support, can help if you get lategame, after support items obviously, and build Maelstrom into Gleipnir. Then suddenly you deal a lot more damage that it's expected from a support. This, together with her ult makes her a mobile turret that the enemy Position 1 will ignore, since they can't hit her for 8 seconds. And if the enemy gets a Reventant's Brooch, or an early Bkb, then congratulations, you made the enemy core waste gold in an expensive item for a support.",Hope-end,13/03/23 10:42:57 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/11pxusg/muerta_is_a_great_position_4/
DotA2,Valve please let us lock avoid slots.,"When you run out of avoids, it automatically removes the oldest avoided player. Mostly functional and I'm mostly fine with that. I tend not to hold grudges and even if I avoid somebody it's usually that I don't want to play with them for the night, chances are I won't remember who they are even next time we cross paths. **However**...we all know Dota has some perpetually toxic trash cans and there are a few people I **do** remember, groan when I see them on my team - surely many of you that play actively can relate? Anyway it'd be nice to be able to lock avoid slots for those people so they're fixed and don't get removed unless you manually do it.

DotA2,It's time to put a limit on comms reports,"Unfortunately, because of the times I play I run into a lot of account buyers from other countries and Eastern Europeans/Russians. This demographic seems to literally just spam reports for nothing.

I never get gameplay reviewed despite I get gameplay reports (because they get overwatch reviewed and I haven't done anything wrong so I don't get convicted lol) but a common factor is they spam the shit out of the comms report button.

Hell, I got comms muted due to spam reports after saying fuck all, and then I got even more spam reports *while I was comms muted*... 

The current system is absolutely busted and open to abuse. Even if you give people a limit of 20 comms reports per week, it stops them from spam reporting quite so much. You can literally report all 9 people in your game every single game for free, and then they end up pre-muted or chat banned.

An example is literally in my last game, my 5 &amp; 2 were both account buyers who were raging and flaming all game, 2 fed mid hard and 5 ruined bot lane. Despite this, because I was being solo killed by the enemy 2, my 3 pos (Naga 3 btw) is flaming me &amp; saying report me for getting solod by a hyper fed enemy mid lol. It's actually insane, and then this person gets a free comms report on me &amp; starts spamming in chat for people to report me for doing absolutely nothing wrong. I didn't even say anything back, just played my game but after I got solod by their mid he just keeps talking shit to me for the rest of the game.",Zooka128,14/03/23 06:49:07 PM,https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/11r2wqs/its_time_to_put_a_limit_on_comms_reports/

DotA2,Techies Rework Rework Rework Idea,"I like New Techies, but I like Old Techies more. I also feel like there is a way to merge the two playstyles together to provide an annoying area denial that can actively engage in team fights between setting up traps. And all with as little AFK mining as possible. This is my attempt at that merge.

**-Proximity Mines moved to Q, loses charges and Magic Resist Debuff, Damage fall off removed. Detonation Delay is increased by 0.3 seconds. Cooldown reduced to 12 seconds. Damage rescaled to 200/350/500/650**

This is to provide a weaker version of the funny blast off/""mine"" combo in the early game, providing Techies some form of active harassment. Increase in Detonation Delay is to provide more heroes of chance of destroying the mine before it explodes when used as area denial.

**-Reactive Taser now provides a 0.5 Second Root whenever the Enemy is disarmed, can now be casted on allies with a 600 cast range. Causes 100/200/300/400 damage whenever enemy is disarmed. Reactive Taser procs when Casting on Allies does not provide the root.**

A Homage to the Statis Trap, merges in the Current Scepter Upgrade into the ability and gives a ""Physical Damage"" Glimmer Cape ability so Techies can Support in only it they can: by annoying the enemy. Mad eit so Techies can only get the root part of the taser as giving that to a Carry in the late game would be too much.

**-Blast Off! Damage increased to 300/400/500/600, will now prove a 0.25 second stun upon landing.**

Damage from Talent partially added as that's getting change, also incorporated a small part of the stun so doing the Land and mine combo is somewhat easier to do and to provide a small amount of utility for catching and chasing.

**-Remote Mines Return, Damage 300/450/600 and now has a limit of 10 Remote Mines on the Map. Any more past the limit and the oldest Remote mine Detonate automatically. Now provides a 30%/40%/50% slow for 1.5 seconds.**

I feel like this is the perfect compromise for techies lovers and haters. A hard limit for the mines makes it so Techies can only deal a max of 6000 damage (at max level, before resistances) with remote mines at any given time. Considering that the current eblade combo deals almost the same amount (If including Magic Resistances after Eblade) without any prep time and that the 6000 damage is only if you use all 10 mines in one area. It seems reasonable. The hard limit also all but kills AFK mining, as it mean you can really only mine for 2 minutes max before having to do something else. the limit of 10 also chosen as it makes it so a Techies player can only reasonably lethally mine 2/3 lanes in the High Ground (two 5 mine stacks). meaning the enemy team always has at least 1 not as dangerous lane to attack from. The added slow debuff is to encourage to have at least 1 Remote mine ""in the chamber"" for a quick nuke and for chasing so you should realistically have 9 remotes out at most.

**-Minefield Sign: Granted once Remote Mines is learned.**

To prevent unkillable proximity mines in early laning.

**-Shard Change: Now Provides Sticky Bombs. Deals 300 Damage, Provides a 35% Slow and a 30% Magic Resist Debuff whenever the Slow is applied. Also deals 25 damage upon sticking to a target (To put blink dagger on cooldown).**

Sticky Bombs are a good ability and shouldn't be thrown into the trash. This change would benefit both the active combo and mining playstyles. As it provides extra damage and ease of comboing for the active combo playstyle. while providing the ability to boost a mine stack by risking yourself to mark the target right before triggering the mines for extra damage. good situational utility all around.

**-Scepter Change: Proximity Mines now have 3 charges and activation delay is reduced by 0.6 seconds.**

Basically, the item to rush for combo playstyle. 3 charges to bust more mines when dropping and the activation delay reduction to counteract the detonation delay nerf and then some to offset the minor decrease in burst damage. Also usable for the mining playstyle by having more Proximity mines to churn out.

&amp;#x200B;

**Talent Changes:**

**Level 10:**

**+175 Cast Range OR +20% Magic Resist**

Incorporating the old Shard into talents. creates a decent choice for survivability for spell spamming.

**Level 15:**

**+1.5 Second Blast Off! Stun OR +1 Second Reactive Taser Root**

Incorporating the old Shard into talents. also creates a choice between long term/escape disable vs Instant Disable

**Level 20**

**-15 Second Cooldown on Blast Off! OR +60 Remote Mine Movement Speed**

Return of the King. the choice between more combos or More Mine-based Map presence. Also notice it says REMOTE Mines and not all mines.

**Level 25:**

**Reactive Taser Root Pierces Spell Immunity OR +253 Damage**

Gives some usability against all the BKBs that will happen in the late game. Originally planned to be a level 20 talent but would probably be too much if combo-ed with the damage talent before level 30.

DotA2,Voice lines help you win,"They may seem even less useful than cosmetics, but all chat voice lines, especially caster voice lines, are really effective at turning the game.

If you're losing, a really good situational voice line like Purge's ""I'm helping"" when you die, really helps you lighten up your own mood and not get tilted that easily. Or if the enemy slips, Lacoste's ""what the herald was that?"" helps tilt them further.

When you're winning, trolling/tilting lines like Ephey's ""Sorry"" and Sheever's ""Calculated"" add to the enemy's frustration. Even nicely timed hero voice lines do the trick sometimes.

When you're going even, voice lines help you become less frustrated and tilt the enwmy.

Since dota is as much about psychology and headspace as it is about skill, the nature of these subtle and ""cosmetic"" items is a pretty impactful contributor to a game's outcome.

DotA2,Why do we need secret shops on the map? Remove secret shops for QOL????,"Albeit nostalgia and appeal to legacy is cute and all, what is the practical reason there are still secret shops on the map?   
What is the gameplay value coming from the idea that some items can be bought only on those two specific locations? It makes itemization just slightly more annoying and tbh does not add anything positive to the game.

Should it not be removed at this point, so that we can just purchase items from the shop menu?

DotA2,Dazzle's Shard Is OP Should Be Removed,"Before you crucify me, let me say Dazzle is one of my 3 most played heroes. I've loved him since he was released in Dota 1. I want Dazzle's shard removed because I love playing him.

&amp;#x200B;

Having such a powerful CC effect warps the rest of Dazzle's kit around it. For a long time, he wasn't picked up much because of his weak CC. The thing is, his ulti has become significantly weaker BECAUSE his shard is so good. It's not just covering his weakness, but outright surpassing other CC focused supports.

&amp;#x200B;

This is bad because it means the things that made Dazzle iconic are being watered down to compensate. He was pretty much always weak in the stuns department. In dota 1 his poison didn't stun til level 3, and was delayed enough it couldn't cancel channels for several seconds.

&amp;#x200B;

Meanwhile, Dazzle's armor shifting is MUCH weaker now than in previous iterations. Because each stack is independent, the amount of armor shifted caps much lower than its ever been. And his cooldowns are higher now than they've been in ages unless spamming, because poison touch is so OP with shard.

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, by removing his weaknesses, his strengths must also be reduced to compensate. This is bad for build and hero diversity. If he must have CC, make it a ministun to cancel TPs and channels.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll end with a suggestion: What if the shard was changed to bring back a Weave style effect which lowered armor every second? Maybe 1 every second and last for a couple seconds after the debuff ends. Would allow for his armor niche to come back and make the poison touch attack range talent actually worth considering.",Garresh,17/03/23 08:56:41 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/11tch6s/dazzles_shard_is_op_should_be_removed/

DotA2,Alliance Inhouse League - Season 5 starts this Saturday 18! Join for free!,"**The Alliance Keppa Kleb Inhouse League - Season 5 launches on March 18!**


We invite all players who despise the toxicity of pubs and desire to have the chance to play in fun, balanced lobbies to join us. Every game will be casted on [stream](https://twitch.tv/drunkmers)

After great success from last season (with more than 240 games played!), we have decided to launch another relaxed, laid-back, and less competitive season. Games will be played mainly on weekends: we will begin Saturdays and Sundays at 16 CET.


**Main information**

Starting on March 18, we will have lobbies starting at 16:00 CET in the following regions: SEA/EU, SEA/EU, EU, EU, EU/NA, EU/NA, NA/SA, NA/SA. Inhouses are filled on a first-come, first-serve basis, but slots will be made available to make sure everyone gets a chance to play and I will host enough lobbies to secure this.

**How can I join?**

* Fill out this form: https://forms.gle/74zQheW6RqM7vf9BA
* Join [this discord](https://discord.gg/SbHySTY)
* React to the DOTA message in the #roles channel to get pinged every time there's an available lobby to join.

**Is it free to join?**
Yes, since this season will have no prizepool and will be mainly for fun, we are allowing most players a chance to sign up and join the community. But, we will also be more strict with toxicity and smurfing, meaning that people who create an unpleasant experience for teammates and cannot behave like decent humans will be banned easier. 

**This year we are also including a discord bot to track ingame stats (by dakoehler):**

DotA2,Does playing unranked with a friend (who is playing on their own acc that's new to dota) mess with ranked matches?,"I have gone from 2.6k to 3.3k in the span of a month since my mmr deprecated due to not playing for a few months. Getting back to 4k has been relatively easy, until I played a few matches with a friend who is new to dota. After we played, I have had \~10-15 dogshit matches of ranked in a row, where I've lost 250 mmr overall. Tonight alone, I had two different matches where my mid abandoned the game by 12 minutes in without saying anything. I have had matches where people do not play the roles they selected and I've had multiple matches where there were clearly smurfs (usually on the enemy team, but they have been on mine as well) despite that not happening at all before playing with my friend. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is probably subconscious bias in some way, but I swear I'm baffled by the consistency and immediacy of the loss of quality in my ranked matches.

DotA2,Genuine question: What makes ATF a tier 1 player?,"Before anyone takes this as a casual ""ATF is trash"" hate thread let me tell you as the title says that this is a genuine question of mine that I have had looming in the back of my head after TI11.

People who support ATF as a tier 1 carry player or just have any sort of higher tier knowledge to the matter than I do, Why is ATF all of a sudden so meh as a player? Is it that the ""gotcha"" effect of his hero pool and individual-based hero skills is finally gone? Is the reason for ATF's lackluster success with carry heroes the drafting in Nigma (He has had games on Sven, Ursa, and Slark, and all three have not been amazing)? Are they prioritizing Sumail too much (the player that has gotten them the majority of their wins)? ATF's decision-making, is it the level you'd expect from a pos 1 player in a division 1 team? Is his microgame even comparable to the likes of Watson or Yuragi (where Yuragi and Watson tend to find the farm on the map even after a rough lane ATF seems like a fish out of water when he gets booted out of the lane^(1))?  I can't answer all these questions myself since my opinions are just opinions and I'm looking for more of a definitive answer. Do you think ATF should've started from a tier 2 team instead as a carry player and worked his way up?

Really appreciate anyone who comments on this, so thank you in advance.

1. *It is hard to look for comparable pos 1 players for ATF since pretty much every team's pos 1 players are amazing as individual players MMR-wise and have spent years and years perfecting this one role, while ATF just woke up one day and chose to be a pos 1 player.*",PhantomHasAIDS,16/03/23 08:24:38 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/11sefwz/genuine_question_what_makes_atf_a_tier_1_player/

I used the Mexican music style based on Muerta's background story, the style of the  El Día de los Muertos and the story of her revenge, and blended electronic music, dance music and other kinds to make her an exclusive BGM.

And I will continue to create more exclusive for each DOTA2 hero, and try to combine dota and music together, to make more people fall in love with music and dota!

DotA2,Looking for people to play relaxed games with,"Hi, 

So I recently came back to dota (haven't played since late 2018), and I've played 90 hours since I came back. I used to be ancient 5 back in the day, but I am nowhere near as good as I was obviously. I'm also not really interested in climbing since I just started grad school and I have time to play maybe 1 game per day depending on how tired I am. Maybe a little more on the weekends. 

I've only played normal matches but even there I notice people get mad a lot, and it even seems that people are simply not having fun while playing, it's all about winning and flaming. So what I'm basically looking for are people that want to just play dota and have fun while at it. Maybe running some silly combos/strats or whatever, and it doesn't matter if we win or lose. 

Let me know if maybe there are some discord servers of such people or just feel free to dm really :)",thisisnotrealhello,16/03/23 09:07:06 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/11sfiju/looking_for_people_to_play_relaxed_games_with/

DotA2,"At lower MMRs, is picking an offlaner who doesn't build blink a terrible idea?","Trying to pick a few offlaners to learn. There's a few i'm interested in but im trying to decide if I should even consider heroes like Razor, Viper, Abaddon because they don't blink + catch. From the games i've played at low MMR, it seems games are very often decided by someone getting caught out of position or just who randomly wins a teamfight late game. It also seems like for both of those things, it often comes down to which team is able to get a blink + catch first. Axe, Tidehunter, Centaur etc seem to just win the game with their blink.

I guess maybe this really breaks down into the question of how should the game be working at the end when your offlaner doesn't have this combo. I played ranked all pick so i'm always the first core to pick as offlane, so I can't draft around my mid. If I pick one of those first few heroes without catch, how do we start teamfights later on? It seems like the team just wants to wait for the offlaner to blink + frontline and doesn't know what to do if that's not an option.",myDotaAltAccount,18/03/23 02:25:55 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/11tzbxo/at_lower_mmrs_is_picking_an_offlaner_who_doesnt/
DotA2,"Some Rubick stolen spells not quickcasting, some needing different hotkeys","Sorry if this issue has been posted already i can't seem to find a related post.

First time playing rubick since 7.32e and I played like 5 turbo matches with friends. Some of spells I stole were quickcasting, like shadow shaman, shrapnels and muerta spells.. But when I got some witch doctor and mars spells, (spear, cask, maledict and deathward) all of them were not quick cast. I ticked and re-ticked all the boxes (D and F for stolen spells), including hero specific hotkeys to quick cast but still they will not quickcast. 

Some spells do not have hotkeys/are different from  D and F.

is this a bug? or a new feature? Or am i stealing the 'settings' of the other player like if he plays with a non-quick casted spell, i get a non quick casted stolen spell?

all of these happened only ever since the new quick cast settings qol update.

Any fixes? Thanks in advance!

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Stolen spells inconsistent. Some not quickcast, some quickcast but i never changed settings. non quickcasted spells cannot be changed to quickcast too.

DotA2,"As Pos 4, Explaining When and How to Play to Prioritize Your Mid Instead of Your Offlaner","I played a game recently where it made sense to me as the Pos 4 Earthshaker to play for my mid storm instead of trying to help my offlane LC who got 10th pick hard countered by a Monkey King. 

When and How to Enable Your Mid as a Pos 4
https://youtu.be/KwVtfgISIUk

Typically I would recommend to pos 4 players that they prioritize securing the game of their lane partner. That doesn’t mean you can’t do bottle refills or rune securing in that scenario, but in terms of the emphasis and what you’re willing to let your offlaner “put up with,” you’d typically want to favor your offlaner rather than mid. 

However, in circumstances where, whether by blind pick or 10th pick, your offlaner gets super hard countered and you have a really weak lane, it’s important to shift your mindset and be ok with letting your offlaner have a hard game, without making desperate attempts to remedy this that are beyond your capabilities to do. 

So in this game, I prioritize securing runes for my mid. I take the enemy mid’s water rune at 4 minutes, then I also show up to the 6 minute rune. I also get to take my mid’s lane for a while while he jungles, which really helps my own game. 

I will still go back to my original lane for a save if needed, or go over there if nothing else is happening. 

In the early mid game, I constantly play around my mid who is strong instead of my offlaner who is weak. I use arcane boots on him constantly, and focus and smoke plays around him. I will also typically follow him with TPs if it looks at all reasonable. 

The net result this game is that even though my pos 3 is down 2100 gold at 10 minutes to their pos 1, my storm has a really good game, and through him we are able to shut down the enemies hard enough to give time for my LC to recover. By 20 minutes, the LC is only 300 gold behind their MK.",Carbonyl_DotA,16/03/23 10:52:46 PM,https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/11swcdy/as_pos_4_explaining_when_and_how_to_play_to/

DotA2,"Tinker is not the only one, what about Arc Warden?","I will preface this by stating that i am ranting and venting after a loss.

It has been pointed out on multiple occasions that Tinker's win rate is and has been above \~55% across basically all MMRs - for what feels like the last year. As far as I have been keeping track, the same seems to be true for Arc Warden. I understand that a lot of practice goes into learning some heroes etc etc., but sorry - what?

I am just a sour Archon complaining about balance, sure, nothing new to see here. But theoretically and conceptionally, heroes such as Wraith King, Ogre and Crystal Maiden should have high win rates in low/medium mmr - not because of how good they are, but because of how relatively easier they are to pilot and execute for lower level players. Yet for some reason, Arc and Tinker are the same pests they are at higher levels. This leaves only two explanations:

1. Hero is OP.
2. Smurfs/Boosters.

I am struggling to understand how both of these issues can continue to go unaddressed for years. I have been trying hard to improve, but I dread queuing up for Pos 2 as I am afraid I am gonna go up against some smurfing Arc Warden (who, like last game, instalocks the hero first rotation and continues to play way above Archon level on every aspect of the game), then lose lane and get flamed by team mates for not being able to beat someone I SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO BEAT.

DotA2,just want to share story from someone i know.,"this story about the guy 8700-9100 MMR smurfing to 5k MMR. this guy only play micro hero brood, meepo, arc. if the hero are banned he used another, but if he use another hero he's so bad. so he decided to smurfing on 4990 mmr. 

the purpose of smurfing is to learn another hero. he uses various hero from 4990 - 5890 with total 83 match. 

then suddenly he got smurf detection from 5890 to 5990 +100 MMR. after that maybe because the joy, he back to use only micro hero brood meepo arc and here the details about MMR gain

5890 +5990 +6070 +6150 +6230 +6290 -6260 +6320 +6380 +6430 +6470 +6510 +6550 -6520 -6490 -6460, after 3 lose streak MMR gain normal again win +30 and lose -30.

after he reach 7120 smurf detection is on again.

7120 +7220 +7300 +7370 -7340 -7410 +7480 -7450 -7420 +7480 +7540 -7510 -7480 -7450,  after 3 lose streak MMR gain normal again win +30 and lose -30.

he reach 7990 (+3k MMR) in 15 days with 230 match. and then he reach 8500 MMR after playing 397 games in 24 days.

**how i know the details? because this guy do streaming and if he got smurf detection, he always type the MMR gain.**

after update inaccessible player profile during the pick phase, this guy not worries that his hero will get banned again (brood meepo arc), cuz he can change his name after the game so other player don't know about him during phase pick.",Head-Doubt-3903,16/03/23 11:16:44 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/11simee/just_want_to_share_story_from_someone_i_know/

DotA2,The horrors of low behavior score,"I’ve been playing dota again after about a 5 year long break. Unfortunately 5 years ago I was a bit of an immature prick and that has landed my account in the trenches of low behavior score. Over the course of the last 30 games I have brought it up from ~3500 to 5000 and the things I’ve witnessed along the way are crazy. Let this be a cautionary tale.

The things that happen in low behavior score:

Queues take 20-30 minutes during any time that’s not prime hours

People hard feeding, and I mean actually running it down because of a small slight during the pick screen or early laning phase. There is usually at least one of these per games.

Multiple games with 2 or more junglers on a team.

People that will not stop flaming once one person makes a mistake. They will keep typing about how that one death lead to everything that goes wrong for the rest of the game.

People with blatantly racist usernames

People who go berserk after an enemy types something small like “?” in all chat.

People who will try to get the enemy team to report someone by saying something like “X player was saying slurs in team chat report pls” when X player has been silent all game

Since the matchmaking pool is so small it is very possible to get the same people again and again, which is bad when everyone hates each other after one game.



It’s been an experience to say the least. Hopefully as I get closer to 10000 the queues will get shorter and the people will be more normal.",SkeletronDOTA,16/03/23 11:40:50 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/11sj4xz/the_horrors_of_low_behavior_score/

DotA2,Techies Tuesday 8 (FINAL): So much for progress.,"Not that anyone cares, but I believe that it is time for me to retire Techies Tuesday/Techies Talk.

You're reading the words of a broken man. I loved Techies. I loved Dota. I was excited for the update, and when I read the patch notes something in me finally settled. It's time to move on, I think. Maybe if Techies gets a rework in the upcoming patch I'll be back, but it doesn't make sense for me to continue. While my posts never really garnered front page attention (beyond Techies Day), it was still enjoyable to make these occasional posts. I deeply enjoyed hearing from and reading the comments of other Techies players. It was great reading everyone's ideas. It was nice knowing that there was a group of people who weren't interested in immediatley hating me for enjoying a hero. It was nice. 

But the fun is over, for now. The Techies are gone and forgotten. I'd be surprised if anything changes going forward. 

In sum, I'm finished. I don't want to leave on a bad note, so I will say this: be kind and remember that we, as a community, are the sum of eachother and we add to something incredible.

DotA2,Request: Option to Hide Your Hero Level,"There should be an option to hide your hero level. I feel like there is an information asymmetry that puts Dota Plus subscribers at a slight disadvantage.

Say I am a level 30 Phantom Assassin playing against a similarly experienced Juggernaut, both of us having hundreds of hours of experience on our heroes. But since he's not on Dota Plus, I would only see that his level is Level 5.

He and his teammates could adjust their play knowing that I have mastery over my hero, while my teammates and I have no idea about his true mastery level.

By having the option to hide our hero level (or at least show it at the maximum level of 5), it would make it more fair.

Was your play ever influenced by the fact that you knew you were playing along with, or against a mastered hero? If it did, then my point is exactly that.

Another point is that your hero mastery immediately adds pressure for you to perform well within your team. When I see a Grand Master of Zeus on my team, I know and expect that he will be good. If I see my Level 20 Techies teammate doing some silly things, I would give him the benefit of the doubt, thinking he knows what he's doing.

Sometimes, it comes to the point that I even want to unsubscribe from Dota Plus just to hide my hero experience so I can enjoy the game more.",GentleCoco,14/03/23 10:51:09 PM,https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/11r875j/request_option_to_hide_your_hero_level/

Is it just me? Is the player base getting better or did I gett flagged as smurf somehow??? I dont even play my 2nd acc for dota anymore since idk how long.

DotA2,HELP! I drove 12.000 km on a moped from Denmark to Syria,"traversing the mountains of the balkans, and vast cotton fields of eastern greece with 35 km/h. I overcame endless engine trouble, breaking of wheel bearings, snapping spokes, arriving to Damascus, seeing the jasmine flowering along the sidewalks, and driving all the freekin way back again, arriving home on my farm with a hard rubber ass and mutant ship-of-theseus-kind of moped, with the back wheel barely hanging on.

I felt like a god damn hero, and then i boot up, lose 10 out of 11 games and go from archon to crusader and once again i'm back in the hamsterwheel of sucking, feeding too many kills and never able to farm faster than 480 gpm. Seriously, can somebody help me??? And don't tell me about bsj, farming backwards and stuff like that. I'm too stupid. Can someone coach me a game of two????? I need a comforting but firm voice telling me why i feed and why it's never me who is responsible for winning the games i play.

DotA2,FPS &amp; Variable refresh rate unable to sync,"I recently bought Gigabyte G24F-2 monitor. FreeSync is enabled and Gsync under NVCP is also enabled for my RTX 2060. Monitor has 165hz refresh rate. The problem is whenever my fps drops below the max refresh rate, I face tearing plus micro stuttering which really annoys me and makes the game feel not so smooth. VRR is working and I have checked it via OSD RR counter and also via G-sync indicator.

Freesync doesn't seem to fulfill its purpose which is to match the refresh rate with my current fps which isn't dropping below 100 by any means so I am well in FreeSync/G-sync range.

The fps counter and refresh rate counter seems to mismatch which seems to cause tearing plus micro stuttering. I have already tried;

1. FreeSync + Vsync ON
2. FreeSync + Vsync ON + Frame limiter (-3 cap)
3. FreeSync + Vsync OFF + Frame limiter (-3 cap)
4. FreeSync + Vsync ON + Nvidia reflex boost

Actually everything that's been guided on BlurBuster forums but FPS and RR doesn't seem to match once the FPS drops below my max refresh rate. Not sure if this issue is specific to Dota 2 or not.

Gotta try on MW tomorrow but again it should work with Dota as well. Please help if anyone have overcome this issue.  


EDIT: Tried COD-MW2 and FreeSync works like a charm. Zero tearing or stutters.",bilalirfan,12/03/23 07:49:41 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/11oz5o7/fps_variable_refresh_rate_unable_to_sync/

DotA2,Outdated heroes,"Which heroes do you believe are outdated? 


This is not a post to hate on Muerta, let's just get that straight right away but with MOBAs getting figured out now and hero design converging to a similar style (disable/damage/passive) which DotA heroes would be fitting to get the Techies treatment? I am thinking about heroes like Dark Seer, Abaddon and Meepo. Their kits(as a whole) are either too unimpactful or just too exploitable in the game. Some of these heroes are also only picked for certain roles because of 1 ability that they have that they boil down to ""that hero that has a debuff/BKB piercing disable"". Scepter and shard feel like band-aid solutions to this problem and I feel that Valve is scared of making a truly unique hero ever again.",InsurreXtioN16,18/03/23 11:32:09 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/11ud8a7/outdated_heroes/

DotA2,Meteor Hammer,"Are you tired of losing games in Dota 2? Do you want to climb the ranks and become a pro player? Well, I have the solution for you: Meteor Hammer.

Yes, you heard it right. Meteor Hammer is the best item in the game, and you should buy it every single game, regardless of your hero or role. Playing support? Get Meteor Hammer. Playing offlane? Get Meteor Hammer. Playing mid? Get Meteor Hammer. Playing carry? Get Meteor Hammer.

Some may argue that it's a situational item, but I say that every situation is a Meteor Hammer situation. Need to defend your high ground? Meteor Hammer. Need to secure Roshan? Meteor Hammer. Need to clear out creep waves? Meteor Hammer. I have never lost a game where I bought Meteor Hammer, and I never will.

DotA2,"Status Inflation, Suggested Term for Debuff Duration Amp","**Skip this post and go to another one if you just downvote it, and there are polls to choose for your disagreement.**

The game already have debuff duration amplification ([Arcane Blink](https://dota2.fandom.com/wiki/Arcane_Blink), [Timeless Relic](https://dota2.fandom.com/wiki/Timeless_Relic), [Spell Steal](https://dota2.fandom.com/wiki/Rubick#Spell_Steal)) that increases debuff duration of the dealer. Then what's on your mind about incoming debuff duration amplification that increases debuff duration from any dealer to the target? The idea could be used on [Rod of Atos](https://dota2.fandom.com/wiki/Rod_of_Atos) new upgrade competing [Gleipnir](https://dota2.fandom.com/wiki/Gleipnir), [Veil of Discord](https://dota2.fandom.com/wiki/Veil_of_Discord) new upgrade, or anything else.

Also, the term could be changed to be Status Inflation with additional word of Outgoing (for current Debuff Duration Amplification) and Incoming (for this idea) in front of it to differentiate them, and they could manipulate slow effect as what Status Resistance could.

That's all from me I guess. My thanks in advance to anyone keeping the discussion civil.

I have been playing Dota for a long time now and always felt like my rank wasn’t deserved as i got better and really focused on fixing my issues and becoming a better player. Everyone always told me that if i was supposed to be at a different rank, then I would be.  I spoke to BSJ and other streamers during their streams and they said it wouldn’t be worth it to create a new account, play 100 hours and recalibrate. They said that i would simply gain mmr if i kept playing games. the thing is though, i listened to them at first and would usually go net neutral in mmr. I was hardstuck in my mmr for months after that and it got extremely frustrating because it felt as if i had a better understanding of the game than the people i was playing with. I had enough one day and decided to create a new account and play 100 hours of unranked. I recalibrated and gained 1.5k mmr, I have played 10 games of ranked so far and have 80% win rate in those 10 games after recalibrating.

DotA2,"Muerta chest, available after 4th?","Hey all, I'm looking to get the pudge and Io sets but I'm not sure it's possible.

I did the math and it looks like, with 0 luck, you're gonna have to spend 6 to 9 hours everyday until April 4th to have a chance at getting enough sets to trade up.

This is based on needing T2 and 3 sets.


------------


There are 6 tier 2 sets and 2 tier 3 

For trading up thats...

6 x 5 tier 1 sets = 30 tier 1 sets

2 x 5 tier 2 sets = 10 tier 2 sets

OR for trading up for every set

6 x 15 t1 sets = 90 tier 1 sets

Which is...

90 x 10 flowers each

= 900 flowers


= 225$ to open 90 chests.

On average each game of All Pick is  40 mins 

2 or 4 flowers per game

450 games with 2 flowers per game
225 games with 4 flowers per game

225 x average of 40 mins per game = 9,000mins or 150 hours

25 days left til april 4th

150 hours of play time on average divided by 25 days remaining, 6 hours of playtime per day to get every set. This is if you're getting 4 flowers EVERY game.

-----‐------

This does not take into account getting tier 2 or 3 sets spontaneously.

I'm wondering if this event is even possible in this time frame or if the chests and all their sets will be available after April 4th.",Permanent_Highschool,12/03/23 12:57:08 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/11op050/muerta_chest_available_after_4th/

* The exponentially weighted averages across each player's 50 most recent tier 1 and 2 pro matches is available in this [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11ExiDnIYbupgsjuSbr9zeaBTXb_xn2N9uyvyD0Gz1bc).
* This guide is purely a quantitative analysis. ~~For a qualitative analysis, I recommend checking out u/flygon727's guides.~~

DotA2,Notice how all int right clickers are getting lower BAT,"lately they are giving lower BAT to all int right clickers to make up for the lack of maybe agilit gain, or their lack of desire to buy agili. for example you don't see as many heroes buy butterfly on np or muerta. even tho the sole difference is the dmg, it's still huge.

i have a theory that this might be a test to lower all non agility heroes' BAT as abaddon also got the buff(right clicker ones anyways). might actually happen to lina also now that she's pure shit, but that would make her op again

**P1:**

Spectre

Phantom Lancer (PL)

Wraith King (WK)

Drow

Juggernaut

**P3:** 

Necrophos

Bristleback (BB)

Underlord

Legion Commander

Centaur Warrunner

Trying to keep my pool small so I obviously can't cover everything but is there anything i'm completely missing that I should fill out?

DotA2,Uninstalled Dota for good because the developers don't really care about adding features that would help their players for good and save them some time!!!!,This fine Sunday I queued up a turbo game which turned out to be a disaster from the start as all the lanes were lost.Some games if you play right can be turned but this one was complete hopeless. The enemies refused to push and end because they had too much time in their hands to sit in front of our fountain and farm us. It took 30 mins for the game to end which could be just 10 if they had ADDED THE SURRENDER FEATURE. I don't get it why they are so adamant to add the surrender feature . If they 3 out of 5 players want to go next just let them surrender and go next . It's that simple.

DotA2,Randoming in Unranked Hasn't Adapted to New Heroes,"In patch 7.20, randoming was updated to exclude the least played 25 heroes from the pool. This wasn't an optional change. Being a random main and playing only unranked means I can't play any of the new heroes by randoming, and if I want to be able to random them, I have to spam them for 20+ games. Additionally, Meepo is my 35th least played hero due to playing the hero almost exclusively over 6 years ago, and I cannot remove him from my random pool without spamming heroes for over 100 games. This problem compounds itself as the gap between the 26th least played hero and the 25th least played hero slowly widens.

The most reasonable solution to the problem is to add an option to disable the hero exclusion from the pool. Alternatively, allowing us to select heroes to exclude would solve this problem as well. I think it would be more reasonable to have 10 optional exclusions, 25 least played exclusions, or no exclusions.",sTgStackfish,16/03/23 11:28:54 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/11sivu9/randoming_in_unranked_hasnt_adapted_to_new_heroes/
DotA2,A Letter to My Side Lanes... from a Mid Smurf.,"Dear side lanes,

I love you, but historically you blame me for losing your lane. There are 2 of you, and at any time you can communicate the success/failure of your lane. This will provide more intell than I can gather while I'm crushing mid.

Sadly, that is not enough, you need to be patience when I gank. I need to be in position, otherwise you'll give away the gank and I might lose mid over that move.

It's 10x more likely I will gank  if you are warding and pulling your lane as well. Again, you are doing this to attract my attention. Which leads me to my last point.

I can only gank 1 lane at a time. It's also my responsibility to not lose mid tower &lt;10 mins to a lina. So don't cry about me not typing to help unless you are willing to tp mid. Seriously... ask yourself when the last time you successfully tpd/rotated mid for a save or kill before 8 mins? Got your answer? Good, it's not enough. I don't need the help, but you're not enabling your smurf which is illogical.

After 1000s of games the data is clear. You're never going to TP mid even if they are diving t2 wirh 200hp left and I'm spamming pings and screaming on the mic.

With love I will continue to gank, but you've lost my trust. You can earn it back with communication and respect. Otherwise, I will continue to smurf, mute you, and 1v9 the game as I typically do.

PS... at low mmr Mid alch isn't going to gank, so just stack for me. If you think a mid alch should gank for you, you should consider a different game at this point.",King_of_Dew,18/03/23 07:16:10 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/11u7cj2/a_letter_to_my_side_lanes_from_a_mid_smurf/

DotA2,Wait until the end of the event for the tier up,"I opened 11 treasures and got only 1 tier 2 item at first drop, so I decided to trade up the other 10 tier 1 to tier 2 and, in total, got 3 tier 2 items. After that, I opened another 10 treasures, but all of them were tier 1. I think the chance of dropping a tier 2 or 3 item will decrease if you trade up your tier 1s first because the algorithm assumes that you got the tier 2 from the treasure and reduce the chance of dropping new tier 2/3 items. Or I'm just unlucky :)

But it is safer to tier up your tier 1s at the end of the event.

DotA2,Scam Alert https://rivalcup.de/,"So, I was just approached by someone in my friends list to try and make me join a tournament as their pos 4 was unable to make it before registration deadline supposedly. I managed to figure out it was a Scam and avoid my account being stolen thankfully. Still, I almost finished the supposed registration and was totally buying into it so I decided to post this here for others to know.

the way this dude approached me was by sending me a private message asking if I was here and when I responded with who this is he asked if I don't remember so I guessed a random friend I used to play with and he kind of went with it. the convo is in the pictures I am posting if you are interested in how it went. I found out that it was a scam when I was asked to register to a foreign site, also this person is supposedly from the US which is what his location shows, but I found a few friends in common between us who I used to know and who are not from the US, I will not say where they are from to avoid any racist stereotypes from being discussed. I also did a little bit of googling about the website and got some red flags. and that is all.

imo she just needs small tweaks ive been spamming her she feels strong but she lacks catch maybe give her some attack range or make the shot range increase with attack range like hoodwink and remove the cast range talent.

why tf the shot stops moveslows from working on enemies ? its kinda stupid seeing a slowed enemy run at 550 ms.

you cant attack in the ult transformation time it works for metamorphs like tb meta or lycan cus they have like 30 sec duration but she just loses 0.5 sec of the 8 sec ult and has to wait there like a headless chicken.

DotA2,Do you like mute and report button default behavior?,"I am writing this to ask you what do you think about the mute and report button and the default behavior to also include the **report** action.

I feel like this button can be seen from two different perspectives:

1. From the perspective of the user that uses that button.
2. From the perspective of the user that the button is used by others to mute and **report** him

My question is: Why do they designed like that, I mean the default to be mute **and report?**

I feel that nobody has a gain in this case.

1. The one that uses the button, in 90% of cases they do not really need to be **report** because they just want to make the guy stop talking.
2. The guy that just speaks a lot, he might just talk a lot, they do not really must be **reported.**

So in this case I am wondering why not making the button default action just **mute**. If somebody insults or really needs to be **reported** let the guy that wants to report do a bit more work, maybe two clicks, not just a simple button click.

If one just presses that does not mean that his intent was to **report** maybe just to make that guy stop talking because he might need to focus.

So my question is, are you guys liking this default extra action of **reporting** or is just me?

My answer to this question is **no,** and I would propose to those designing the UX of Dota2 to change it, to just **mute** and change the behavior with two button clicks or something similar to also **report** somebody.",mrtuxpro,16/03/23 04:10:24 PM,https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/11snv5k/do_you_like_mute_and_report_button_default/
DotA2,Supporter Packs Chat Wheel keybinds,"Since the new supporter packs are out, I thought I'd make a list of the chatwheel numbers for binding supporter pack phrases to keys. To bind one of these to a key just open console and put in `bind {key} chatwheel_say {number}` for example to bind ""Team Liquid - I don't consider myself the best player."" to k on your keyboard the command is `bind k chatwheel_say 141952`

Of course you have to have the phrase unlocked to actually use these, and unfortunately binding in this way does not allow you to use emoji like using the actual chatwheel.

DotA2,Mureta's needs a rework.,"Take a 2nd &amp; think about her skill synergy, and what exactly is she suppose to accomplish design wise. To me, it seems like someone couldn't decide how to combine all the cool ideas they had, and stuck them all together. 

I mean it's great to have versatile heroes, that can play multi roles, but this one ends up as a mess, and let me explain why... I want to keep this brief, so here's the Gist.

&amp;#x200B;

**CURRENT**

* 1st two skills are both very support like. They both nuking spells, with a disable of some sorts. They don't really do anything when it comes to helping a hero be a carry.
* 2nd two skills on the other hand, are both right click abilities. Great for a carry, but require the good farm to make good use of them... the complete opposite of what a support wants.

That is the issue right there. Her skills are so evenly split, it's hard to build items for a hero like that, and make a good impact. Maybe if they were one sided more she could have something to lean towards, but she's stuck in an ugly place right now.

&amp;#x200B;

**SUGGESTION:** Don't balance her. Begin the process of reworking her. Either keep her current concept &amp; delve deeper into the core role, or change her to a more support hero... Personally if the drastic change of a support were to happen, I'd prefer her with one gun, or become a musician, but that's another topic.

**P.S.** *Her ult sucks. Essentially it's just bonus dmg, with the utility to avoid physical dmg, but with the trade of to do less or no dmg to spell resistant enemies. Give her Lifestealer's passive ability as an ult to deal more dmg based of an enemies HP, and she won't need a rework.*",Venichie,13/03/23 05:08:53 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/11ppx80/muretas_needs_a_rework/

DotA2,Petition to add all chat voice-option between competing teams!,"Maybe it's just the marijuana talking, or maybe, just maybe, would it be cool to have the option to talk using your mouth with the other team? I don't know, I keep thinking about soccer and how it would be if the players on the opposing teams only had the ability to write to one another. I think banter between athletes is really fun. I like the ""pretend"" feud. If you have brain, even a cooked one, you should realize that at the end of the day, it's just a fucking game and it doesn't matter. 

In dota I always try to redirect my teammates hatred towards me to the other team. Like, those are the real villains, right? And of course, if you don't want to hear russian techno from a mic with sound-quality of a potato, then you can mute, right? We're all (almost all) adults here.

DotA2,What is happening with the bot's games ?,"To give you some context, I am a new player. I have very few game of dota 2. So to learn the spell of some hero, the mechanics of the game all these kinds of stuff, I wanted to play against bot with human to not int normal games. But each time I queue for a game against bot, I don't get human's teammates (even if I specified that I wanted real players). The issue is that in hard mode and higher, have bots in your teams feels super buggy and not interesting. So, at this point, I am kinda forced to play normal games. So I will have to int the next 100 games for 9 players the time I learn the base mechanics of Dota2. Is there someting I do not understand ? Is there some sort of protection when you are a new player so the matchmaking don't make me play with player that played Dota 2 for 1000 h ?

DotA2,Switched from League of Legends to Dota 2 but...,"Hey guys,  


I just made the switch from LOL to DOTA2 recently but I'm confused about which position to main.  
I used to main jungle in LOL because I liked to move around the map freely, get kills, take objectives, **skirmish 1V1**, or in small team fights.  
Plus I like to play melee fighters or assassins... I dislike tanks and supports.  
So Pos4 doesn't feel right...Most heroes that are played in Pos4 are more of a support than a fighter.  


I tried to see which Dota heroes are similar to the LOL champions via a website and most of the heroes I got are carry heroes for Pos1 like ""Juggernaut, Slark, Ursa, Troll, Sven, Lina, Drow Ranger, Phantom Assassin, spectre, Shadow Fiend""  


But I don't wanna be stuck on a side line for 20 min farming cs   
(watching my support do dumb shit 😂 This was the main reason why I stopped playing ADC in LOL)

DotA2,Do you like Lifestealer's aghs? Cos me likey so much (4k MMR gaming),"I know this is kinda an unconventional build, but i have 8 winning streaks with this build. It's kinda fun too!

Skill build will depend on how good/bad your lane is. If you can easily harras their offlaner, then max 3. If you need to keep trading hit, max 2 or at least skill up 2 points. I normally start with orb of corrosion and phase boots. Then rush radiance. Once I have radiance, I can pretty much join the team fight. Then the next item will be the satisfying aghs.

This is where the fun starts. With +150 infest damage talent, you can pretty much nuke any supports. Basically when you infest the enemy (not your ally), you get free hits, slows, radiance burn, life steals, disarming, and big nukes at the end. 

Then depending on how the game goes, I usually like to buy BKB on top of rage. Basically all you have to do is to survive for 20secs (yes, aghs reduces your ulti). So buy whatever you need to ""get inside"" your enemy over and over again (yamete kudasai senpai!!). 

There was a match where I had to buy BKB, Linken, and Manta just because the enemy team had many silence and cc. You might think ""bro, you deal no damage with that build"". But in fact I dealt over 150k damage in that match, even my items were not built around high damage items. Abyssal is also a good choice if you need lockdown, infest will also proc bashes.",Ukeklele,13/03/23 06:09:24 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/11prgxq/do_you_like_lifestealers_aghs_cos_me_likey_so/

DotA2,EG v.s. Shopify Game 3,"Late post but it hurts so much watching this game.

Shopify played great, those Lucent beams into Cr1t tosses were well-coordinated. Same goes for EG's chain stunning Rtz into kills.

But why is EG playing so greedy? Against a zeus, luna's Lucent beams and eclipse, where are the pipe and lotus orb? Then Pakazs tping into every fight, bkb hits Rtz 3 times, then changing focus to Fly. What threat does a silencer pose after pressing his R button? It's not a priority hero like an Oracle or Shadow Demon with a save.

Not from SA, but find it a real pity for EG to lose in a game that can go both ways on their home ground with so much love ~~whistling~~ from the crowd.

If I am missing something, please do share. Just trying to understand the game better. Thank you.

DotA2,Major's Dota 2 team ranking?,"Hey Reddit, I just wanna share my own ranking of Dota 2 teams and regions. At first I just wanted to know the power of regions because the theme of major slots' dividing is pretty actual nowadays, so I wondered how can we measure teams' performances by some value.

I was inspired by UEFA national associations ranking (or maybe it was just the team ranking, don't remember). They used to give teams points for wins or draws, bonus points for achieving a high place in tournaments, and (maybe I'm wrong) they used to assign smaller coefficients for earlier tournaments. This idea seemed to me pretty interesting, that's why I tried to adapt it to DPC system.

&amp;#x200B;

***NOTE:*** in my opinion, there is no perfect way to make a clear team ranking, as well as in any other sport, and I don't state that my system is even a good one, but maybe someone will find it curious or interesting at least. It was created just out of curiosity and I'm ready to discuss technical or some other highlights in comments.

&amp;#x200B;

# Here are the base rules of the ranking:

&amp;#x200B;

**1)** As we want to measure teams on the international arena, DPC leagues results are not counted. Only results on Majors and TI's are included.

&amp;#x200B;

**2)** The team gains:

* *2 points* for winning a bo2 or a bo3;
* *1 point* for draw in a bo2 or winning a bo1;
* *0 points* for losing a bo1, a bo2, or a bo3 either.

&amp;#x200B;

***NOTES***:

Winning a bo1 gains only 1 point because sometimes it can be quite randomish.

Losing a bo3 with 1-2 score gains 0 points because when bo3 is played on TI or Major there's always no matter you lose it 0-2 or 1-2: it will always gives you the same change of the tournament situation.

Tie-breaks are also included.

&amp;#x200B;

**3)** Team gains up to 6 bonus points for finishing in the top 8 according to the following order:

* 7-8th place - *1 point*
* 5-6th place - *2 points*
* 4th place - *3 points*
* 3rd place - *4 points*
* 2nd place - *5 points*
* 1st place - *6 points*

Bonus points for placing high in Wild Card tournaments are not scored.

&amp;#x200B;

**4)** There are a coefficients attached to every tournament. They are determined by the following rules:

* Last (or ongoing) tournament has a 1 base coefficient. Earlier tournament has a coefficient of 0.8; earlier to it - 0.6, etc., down to 0.2.
* TI's coefficients are doubled.
* If tournament has a wild card stage the coefficient of WC tournament has a base value of 0.5 (0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1), no matter it's TI or not. I can not give WC a bigger coefficient because such teams like Team Liquid or Team Secret would get TOO MUCH points for a TI 11 Last Chance, for example.

&amp;#x200B;

**EXAMPLE**. Up to now the coefficients dividing looks like this:

\- Lima Major - 1

\- TI 11 - 1.6

\- TI 11 LCQ - 0.4

\- PGL Arlington Major - 0.6

\- ESL One Stockholm - 0.4

\- TI 10 - 0.4

&amp;#x200B;

When the Berlin Major will begin the picture will change to this:

\- Berlin Major - 1

\- Lima - 0.8

\- TI 11 - 1.2

\- TI 11 LCQ - 0.3

\- Arlington - 0.4

\- Stockholm - 0.2

&amp;#x200B;

**5)** I used to assign points to organisations, that means Betboom Team got their points for both the old and new rosters, despite they are completely different.

There's only one exception - Evil Geniuses points include the results of the old Thunder Awaken roster, as well as Shopify Rebellion include the results of the old EG. I think that this should be fair.

&amp;#x200B;

**THE LAST EXAMPLE BEFORE THE LIST.** Let's count the points of Team Liquid.

Their score is **25 points** for Lima Major (6 bo2 wins (12 points), 2 bo2 draws (2 points), 3 bo3 wins (6 points) and reaching the 2nd place (5 bonus points)), 25\*1.6 = **40 pts** for TI 11, 16\*0.4 = **6.4 pts** for TI 11 LCQ,  7\*0.6 = **4.2 pts** for PGL Arlington Major and 7\*0.4 = **2.8 pts** for ESL One Stockholm.

Overall the sum of their points is 25+40+6.4+4.2+2.8 = **78.4**.

&amp;#x200B;

# So here's how the ranking currently looks like:

https://preview.redd.it/k869g2a4i3na1.png?width=931&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=0b42b0fd68f11f575b0f5d528f7f48e7de939cdd

***Some notes:***

* There are 6 teams from the WEU, and all of them are in the top 12.
* The bottom WEU team, Entity, is higher than the top SEA team, Talon.
* Despite Team Secret and OG have missed the last major, they are still holding their positions in top 10.
* However, winning the last major gave Gaimin Gladiators only the 10th place on the list.
* Ranking clearly shows, that the SA region has two solid teams and it is not a weakest region at all.

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Let us think a bit more about the slots dividing. If we sum points of the teams from the one region, and if we sum all the slots the region got on every tournament we consider, we can calculate the average amount of points gained by an average team from a single region.

For example: China's points sum is 167, and sum of its slots is 5 for TI 10 + 0 for Stockholm + 3 for Arlington + 2 for TI 11 LCQ + 3 for TI 11 + 4 for Lima = 17.

Average amount of points that a single team from China gains one one tournament is 167/17 = 9.82

And so we get interesting results:

Honestly idk what exact conclusions we can make from this data and is it right to make any of them, but if I relied on thus I'd rather say that it is fair to take away a slot from China and give it to SA (which was oblivious without this ""research"" haha).

Also we may notice that the SEA region looks like the ""weakest"" and only the Talon's good performance in Lima keeps it's index on the road.

2. What size should be the pool prize? How much is attractive for players?
3. Which is better 5v5 or 1v1?
4. Initially, we are looking at 40 teams (players worldwide) is that possible? It may be a 3-day all online event.

DotA2,"Rewatching Nigma's series, MC as pos.1 can work. It's just that ATF needs to play better.","Rewatching the Nigma game, I can confirm that ATF was the biggest reason why his team lost G1 and G3, he had a great game 2 but the weakest link in G1 and G3. 

That forced skilling of pounce alone in the Slark game already put his team on the backfoot, they did not have the essence shift + IO combo powerspike at level 1. Let's not forget feeding the opponent's MK in the lane, I don't know what was going in his head. Those aggressive positioning vs. a distrupter + BH, he was forced to use Ulti literally every single fight to survive the glimpse combo. He was useless in majority of the fights, imagine if he wasn't the won getting caught everysingle time and the one jumping on the distrupter first.  

In game 3, Once again Sumail had an amazing game but MC was behind and playing catch-up as he had a rough lane. Mr. ATF decides to go 4-4-0-1 on Mars and not join any fights while sumail was at his power spike. MC had no fucking space to farm, ATF was jungling farming top while MC was struggling bot, he even got solo killed by the DP due to their ward. 

I honestly think that MC did not have a bad first showing as the safelaner. He won his lane as a Pango and he had a great game as the spectre.

Also Sumail, playing out of his mind for the past 2 seasons. I am not sure what Nigma will do if he has a bad game :(",ace-s,17/03/23 01:38:37 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/11t0tcj/rewatching_nigmas_series_mc_as_pos1_can_work_its/

I'm not blaming it 100% on the game but it had an influence on me. Made me more angry, cursing and mocking anyone that get on my nerves, even though it is just a small mistake. During my Immortal rank climb, I tried to become less toxic and be more forgiving. It proven to be helpful. I'm sorry to those who I have hurt verbally and thank you DoTA for all these years. DoTA will always be the best game for me.

P/S: Hopefully I can quit this game. Getting married in May so I need to stop because I can't control my toxicity behaviour. This is a me problem.

DotA2,Muerta's W and R muts be swapped Just like how PL got a swap before in my opinion. here is why.,"As we all know muerte is abyssmal atm. with the shit winrate shit stats shitty unsynergizing spells blablabla. While i was playing and watching people play her, i realized a possible rework on her. Just an idea, i hope to get your answers on it on why it could work or could not.  


Her ult is janky as F. You go full magic yes but it does not work at all. Many cores especially the melee cores build mage slayer into bloodthorn, thus making her pretty much useless in ult form, rather than being threatening. I saw qojqva and gorgc play her. And qojqva memefully used her ult vs antimage and pudge few times to test and her already low dmg became even lower it was hilarious at one point.  


Her W Has no idea what it wants to be. A slow? disable? kite spell? gapcloser? make it easier to land a Q? either way i never found a decent reliable way to use it rather than just cause more fuckshittery during fights or place it in a way it will farm  


In my opinion her W and R should be swapped. her ult becoming a situational skill for going ether form to deal magic dmg and a possible way to counter ghost form from heroes such as pugna is decent.   
While her W after swapping will become a dmg amp for muerte, like drow ult. People in the area will be slowed and the spirits will leash the player for 0.5 second instead of silence (lvl 20 talent giving 1 more second leash, lvl25 talent making the leash pierce spell immunity blabla just random ideas here) and while in the area, muerta's attacks will pierce the natural magic resistance like drow R does, while resist from items, passives, auras will stay. So if she uses the calling with the ether form, her dmg will be amplified as they both synergize, making a possible ethereal blade build decent and actually deal dmg.  


Ofcourse her W and R will be tuned down accordingly to make it acceeptable. but a system like this would make muerta a decent core rather than a pos4 with pos2 dreams.",IShatMyselfInDota,13/03/23 01:34:39 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/11pkeyx/muertas_w_and_r_muts_be_swapped_just_like_how_pl/

DotA2,Muerta is a support hero,"I played and experimented with Muerta quite a lot and I believe she’s a SUPPORT hero at best. Her 45.27% winrate prob is from how she is not fully utilized and is played in the wrong position. Here’s how I play her:

Dead Shot:
Her Q can bounce off trees (cuts the tree upon hit) and enemies and will stop till it hits a Hero. It gives vision which is okay. I use this primarily to stack to camps in one go which is great. Range is okay and scales well in late game. The bounce off something makes the range great. Pretty good disruptor for melee units and can be used for farming if needed. Can also use to cancel skills/ults (those annoying  Lion drain, Bara charges, LC duel). Attack modifier procs with this skill so use that as well. This skill is pretty annoying if you get it down right.

The Calling:
It slows atk and movespeed inside its area and silences units hit by the circling remnants (also deals damage). This is an okay skill. What’s bad is that it has terrible cast range to be really good. Synergizes okay with Q skill to get that silence in. I use this primarily for the silence (hit em with the remnant right away). Can also use to create space or control back lines.

Gunslinger:
Passive skill which allows you to hit two targets. Pretty straight forward passive.

Pierce The Veil:
Immune to Physical damage. I pretty much just use this as an escape skill from physical carries.


Core items is pretty much just Arcane Boots, Aether Lens (Octarine) and Force Staff (save/reposition) then whatever your team needs. She’s an INT hero so some support items benefit her right click. I usually start with wards mangoes and clarity. So you play her like most ranged sups. She’s slow so your best bet is to not find yourself out of position in team fights.",gylisgod,13/03/23 10:38:34 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/11pxrf8/muerta_is_a_support_hero/

DotA2,What's you opinion about the gametime?,"So I would consider myself a DOTA Veteran. I was here when the Beta started and played a lot in WC3. My only 'mistake' was that I played easy mode back then. But I haven't played DOTA regularly since 4-5 year and it's stil my most played game on steam.

I had fun with HotS but LoL never catched me as DOTA did. I chated with friends, because I'm desperatly trying to bring them back to the game and most argue with 'a game takes too long'. The thing is: I totally agree with that! 30-45min game is too much. Even in CS:GO they introduced short rounds and that's bringing player back! What I liked about HotS so much were the short play time (rarely the game took 30mins) and the smaller map (in general you're more mobile there). Turbo is not the answer to that. It's not same as playing a normal mode match because deaths and kills gives you a double reward in that time and you're not mobile enough to comeback. It snowballs pretty fast.

So I'd like to know your opinion about it. Should DOTA adapt to a faster paced game with a smaller map or more mobility and a less longer playtime or stay how it is? I'm curious about your opinion",Grumpy23,15/03/23 06:42:15 PM,https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/11rsp9p/whats_you_opinion_about_the_gametime/

DotA2,Help Me Master Leshrac,"Hi! I am a new player and after having tried a few heroes I have decides to spam leshrac in the mid role. It does not matter what the enemy team picks I always pick leshrac. I have even picked leshrac even after the enemy picked invoker, antimage and nyx in the same team. I generally prefer to pick in the 2nd phase but sometimes if I feel my team isn't going to pick and get gold penalty I just pick it. Currently I have 73 games on Leshrac with a win rate of 58.90%.

I have been trying a few things to improve. Please provide me feedback on them. Additionally you can suggest me things I can do to improve as well. These are the things I have been trying so far.

1. Last hit training with just 2 Iron Brances 
2. Click accuracy.
3. Reaction time training.
4. Watching replays of pro players and high skilled players.
5. Watching replays of my own games and reviewing them.
6. Demo hero to checking out various interactions.
7. Trying to get items within time. I check dotaprotracker to know item timings.
8. Trying to achieve a certain number of cs and networks within certain time. I use dota 2's Dotaplus to know the exact numbers.
9. Improving map awareness more by looking at the map more while I am lanning to know how the other lanes are going, who has what items. This would give me valuable information for planning ganks and estimate gank potential.(This hasn't been going well. I find it very difficult or forget to check map while I am Lanning because I am trying to outplay the opposing mid and control the lane)
10. Trying to be better at rotations. (Has improved slightly but I know i can do much better.)
11. Stacking camps while lanning so I can get neutral items for my team as soon as the time hits 7 minutes. (Hasn't been going well. I just can't seem to find the space to leave lane and when I do have the space I either forget or can't decide if it's worth it.)

To step it up and be more efficient I am thinking if trying the following:
1. Memorize bounty rune spawn timings.
2. Memorize timings of flag bearer so that I don't miss a single flag bearer in the entire game. I know they span every 1:30 minutes from the 2 minute mark but I don't know what that would translate to in time unless I calculate it on the spot 😂
3. Calculate Time taken for various movements for example how long does it take for the creep wave to reach from base to mid, calculate and memorize how long it take me to go from mid to various camps, lanes and locations with base movement speed and with various items. I feel that if I know the timings of these I can play the lane more efficiently since I know long it will take me to leave the lane to do an activity and get back to lane. So I can weigh the cost and benefit.

Please provide me feedback and let me know if I am doing things right or wrong. If you have additional feedback on how I can improve then please suggest them as well. I would be truly greatful. Thank you! 😇

DotA2,How do you farm as P1 when both sidelanes are losing?,"I've been trying out P1 a bit. I watched a few guides online and pretty much all of them are:

1) Just try not to die during laning phase

2) When lane gets too dangerous, farm top lane/jungle

and every video the offlane has pushed the enemy carry out of lane and it looks mostly abandoned. P1 farms the little bit of enemy jungle + lane.

In my last 3 games this hasn't been an option. Either offlane lost the lane is still going. When that happens i'm not sure what to do. It's often too dangerous to stay in my lane so the only thing I can farm is the safest part of my jungle and the 2 camps on the offlane jungle. That's what i've been doing but I feel like i'm falling really far behind in net worth without being able to touch the waves.

Any advice? Any good videos that cover something like this?

And he just said, I'll feed if Slark doesn't buy Ward. Clock has every reason to be angry, but I don't think purposefully feeding  will help. However, he did 1-19, and we lost as a result. Slark was also pretty terrible too, and he didn't care if cg was feeding or if we lost.What should I do other than blacklist them and report them?

Sure, that's true, but honestly, the game has gotten *a lot* more forgiving as well, along with some major power creep. Just a few examples:

- Regen stuff like Salves and Clarities used to get cancelled by creeps. You used to have to be very careful with how and when you used them. Nowadays you can just use them without worries.

- Heroes used to have way less efficient skills. Take Wraith King for example, his skeletons allow him to farm a lot faster. He didn't have that, it was just a normal lifesteal. 

- Heroes have overall gotten a *lot* tankier. I watched a game where a Mushi Storm Spirit had BKB and Linkens and was lvl 20, he had 1400 HP. Nowadays, Storm Spirit can easily get to 2K+ hp pre lvl 15. 

- Single courier for everyone, no free items shipped to you in lane all the time.

- No backpack, no dedicated slot for TP scroll. 1 slot in your inventory was always reserved for TP scroll.

There is much more, but you get the picture. To be clear, players have definitely gotten a lot better at the game, but we should also keep in mind that compared to now, you had way less tools at your disposal.",Morgn_Ladimore,10/03/23 05:41:03 PM,https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/11nkllm/ive_been_rewatching_some_older_pro_matches_and/

DotA2,"Animation back-swing is confusing, poorly documented and p2w/p2l, should definitely be changed.","TL;DR: back swing behavior is hat-related, this situation should be changed.

What is animation back-swing? It's a wierd behavior of the DOTA2 client. I say client, since it has nothing to do with the server, and can be changed by (at least for now) legal client modifications. Yet it affects the game.

For example, if you are a PA player and you are lucky enough to obtain an arcana for her, you must have a wierd behavior of pressing a lot of W (phantom strike) after pressing Q (stifling dagger) since if you only press once, then you may stand there for almost a whole fucking second before you blink to your enemy. Why? Back-swing. It equals the duration of the animation sequence (you can obtain this infomation with dota2 dev tool) of your heroes' current model, minus the cast animation. PA arcana has a notorious animation sequence duration of stifling dagger (1.2 second) comparing to normal model (0.9 second), meaning a 0.9 second back-swing (1.2-0.3) if not cancelled.

How does back-swing affacts the game? Well, every act inside a action queue will only be performed AFTER the back-swing of the previous act finished. How will you form a action queue? There's two way to form a queue: 1. using shift and 2. just press another key before the previous ability is cast. For example, as a PA player, if you press w after you pressed q and before the cast animation finished (0.3 second), then the w is in the action queue. The back swing can be canceled after the cast animation is finished, but in reality, few people will be so confident to press w just 0.3 second after they press q. Most mortals like me just spam WWWWW till we see she blinks on her enemy.

If that's the end of story, that would be not that annoying. But there are hats, especially those change heroes model. PA is a pay to lose example, but earthshaker is a pay to win one. ES's arcana has a animation of 1.46667 second for his Q, while normal model has 1.8 seconds. This is a minor but not neglectable advantage. Which makes things even worse is not obtainable  for newer players.

What I suggest here, is to remove the effects of backswing to action queue entirely, meaning if the subsequent act will perform immediately after the previous one take into affect, not wait for it back-swings. This will make the game experience much more crisp and friendly, and will remove the p2w/p2l problem caused by back-swing entirely.

PLZ Valve, change this, not make band-aid fix like you did for AM's persona.

Edit: Another solution is to decouple back-swing with model-specified animation sequence, which relates to hat.",tontyoutoure,17/03/23 03:37:58 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/11t3zc9/animation_backswing_is_confusing_poorly/

with the copium and hopium of next update changing the game, i figured its time to share the real position of arc warden before this era comes to an end (possibly?)  


here are my stats according to valve, i know, not very trusted. but I went on Dotabuff and tried to replicate them, last year stats, got 70% win rate as pos 4. still close. idk which is more accurate.

i also experimented with pos 3 right before last TI so they barely made it into this year stats and i am glad they made it lol. back then I was getting meteor hammer pos 3. i would guess with the new hammer its even stronger but i havent played a single offlane arc for the last 6 months or so  


anyway, the real deal is Pos 4 !!! usually I get flamed during lanning stage, but as soon as i hit 6 the enemy just suffocate. and my team breath, and life is great. suddenly everyone on the team likes me after they insulted my mother. lmao

DotA2,Celebrating 200 days of 7.32!,"With the 200th day anniversary of 7.32 it holds the mark of **longest 7.XX patch** in Dota 2 history! *Here's to another 200 days!* ^^(/s)

* Let's discuss how the meta shifted: the addition of Primal Beast to CM, the meteor hammer meta, and the BKB love/hate relationship.

* Considering the DPC calendar and Valve's announcement, the next patch may release between the Berlin Major and DreamLeague, on April 21st to 23rd. That gives us at least **40 more days** of 7.32, if it really comes out in April.

* Possible needed tweaks for Muerta to be added to CM next patch. Scepter and Shard ideas?

DotA2,New (analog) keyboard = 'CONFIG LOADED: Gamepad' - huh?,"Dear redditors I´ve a question since I get 'gamepad settings loaded' msg, when I open dota. Its definitely my new keyboard (Wooting HE60). This is a very popular keyboard in other esport titles, so I  decided to pull the trigger, since I was searching for a new keyboard. And I´m loving it

This keyboard has multiple profiles and I always switch between 2 of them.

For typing I use the standard typing profile (digital profile).

For gaming (and ofc my main game is dota) I use the rapid profil, because the keys activate alot faster (on release point instead of the full travel standard key activation point).

When I log in into Dota while my analog profile is activated I get the 'CONFIG LOADED: Gamepad' MSG (Sorry for the bad picture but since this is a 60% keyboard I cant do a screenshot fast enough rn)I don´t get this popup when I´m on the typing/digital profile.

And I´m just curious if I can get some trouble? For performance reasons I disabled the gamepad option via the '-nojoy' launch option loooong time ago.

Im not sure if this subreddit is the correct one or if I should ask in a sub for keyboards.

Sorry for my bad english its not my main language =)

DotA2,Suggestion: Introduce connected accounts to reduce smurfs and boosters,"One of the biggest problem of Dota are generally smurfs. 

I agree that having multiple accounts should not be punishable if used in certain conditions like waiting to queue a match for too long, loosing account and etc.

But mostly it's miss-used or rather exploited.

Before someone is detected as a smurf he needs to play certain number of games which ruins a game for other players. 

My proposal would be to introduce something like connected accounts. If people actually have other accounts they should link it to the one they use for smurfing. That way there would be sufficient info for matchmaking and also it would help differentiate between people who are miss-using concept of multiple accounts and people who really need it.",harisk_92,14/03/23 03:47:32 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/11qjjg9/suggestion_introduce_connected_accounts_to_reduce/

DotA2,Many of you aren't aware but DotA 2 modding permanently died this week.,"I don't know how to begin, this is just like our DotA's epic origin story, how pendragon betrayed everyone and buried many developer names. 

But either way on to the topic.

I've been using DotA 2 mods since 2016, at my first time I was really scared of knowing what will happen, since I only play on one account and I never cheated in any game online. I read many comments saying you'll get permanent ban bla bla bla none of it was true, it was like virgins giving you advice about how to do many positions without having practical knowledge and I discovered this when I dove deep into the water solo without thinking of any consequences and I'm glad I did.

From 2016 to this date I was never banned for using mods, mods are basically made of voice packs, maps, weathers, voice line, hero items, couriers, cursor etc., 

Only you can see these mods and since the beginning I remember using DotA2Mods it only had users around 700 or 750 after that it only decreased but Valve is smart even then they shutdown every modders attempt.

At first during 2020 I think the latest patch from DotA 2 dropped and it disabled all the mods, from custom mods to software called DotA2Mods and even overwolf skin changer.

But a guy named wolf later on made a software named DotA2Patcher which bypassed the Valves system and gave you re access to modding, he even unlocked DotA 2 Plus but obviously nothing paid was unlocked only helpful features like stack timing and guides were there to help to bypass paywall. But this week even he got nuked so finally there is no hope left for DotA 2 modding and everyone just has to play plain and simple DotA 2.

Some people think modding is unfair because it unlocks your items skins for free but I mostly used custom sets made by the creators, such as Blizzard pandaren brewmaster as storm spirit. 

Plus only you could see these sets so it didn't affect the steam economy.",Zealousideal_Cry5914,11/03/23 09:59:40 PM,https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/11okvvs/many_of_you_arent_aware_but_dota_2_modding/

DotA2,"I got to Immortal, and lost my friends in the process","I'm such a terrible human when it came to Dota 2.

Back then, I played position 1 with a team made of my closest friends. We would then compete in a friendly inhouse league where I would just be the WORST human being. 

When we would win, I would make my friends on the opposite side feel like shit with below the belt trashtalk.

When we would lose, I'd dc even before actually losing (one time I dc'ed because my 5 left lane) and would ignore ALL of my friends and just play solo queue.

I had this ""badboy of Dota"" personality and it didn't help that my idols were EE and many Russian pro players.

Instead of having fun whenever playing ranked with people, I started loathing my friends because I began to think they were holding me back.

So I let them know that, point blank.

And not before long, I got the feeling that they didn't wanna play with me anymore, so me being the Dota asshole that I was, told them first that I didn't wanna play with them.

This was also a shitty timing, because the pandemic starting only increased the distance between me and my friends. Literally solo queue ingame and irl.

# Developer log:

&gt;A couple of days ago I was watching a streamer play Rankdle and saw him as well as his chat wishing there was a Dota 2 Rank Guesser so I figure I'd give it a try. I been developing games for over 12 years- 9 of which have been professionally at different studios so I knew I could do this pretty quickly.  
&gt;  
&gt;There were a couple more features I wanted to add/improve upon but unfortunately I have other projects that take priority at the moment.

I also upload a lot of game development related content on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/Daitli), I have made a few DotA games in my [Fiverr series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7-cqsVREuR2ihJlvGpgeXX_ALgZ9pGRK) as well as many tutorials on [how to program DotA abilities using C#.](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7-cqsVREuR1PQlq7vHnL6vunebrykt1j)

DotA2,Infuriating when people don't respect roll for lane,"You start a game. Someone marks mid, you do so right after, and they say ""I marked first, move"". Fine. You move.  
Then you play a 2nd game, mark mid first, and then another person soon also marks mid. The person rolls. You roll, lose, and move. Fine. The most fair way. A bit annoying given last game, but fair.  


Then you start another game, the other person marks the lane first, and you do so right after. You roll 91, and the other person and their friend are just start saying BS and don't move.

Sometimes it feels like there's no winning with this player base. I did report both in game and afterwards but hard to say if any action will be taken about it.

Sorry for the rant but it should be clear if this kind of behaviour is indeed punished (apart from the communication abuse).",DracoDruida,19/03/23 07:37:12 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/11v4ngn/infuriating_when_people_dont_respect_roll_for_lane/

DotA2,"Do you ever encounter a teammate that just has a problem with the way you play or the hero you pick, and then other teammates start watching you with a magnifying glass and gang up on you?","As titled, once I start getting shit from the most toxic guy in the team the other people jump in easily. 

Like the other day there was this person who didn’t like the choice of my hero and started calling me names and nit picking everything I do. And later people just jump in and started nit picking too.

And I get it if I’m doing bad, but it’s always the people who are doing terrible and not making any impact during the game while I’m having a decent KDA, supporting, warding defending and pushing towers. 

Has similar situations happen to anyone?
It usually happens when we are having a hard game. 

So I don’t know if it’s because they need someone to blame? Or I just become an easy target for the rest of the team to bully since someone started it already? What do u guys think?

EDIT2:
I’m talking about a scenario where you are performing better than the teammates who are giving you shit. Not one where you are clearly throwing (that happened to me too but I just accept it cuz I could have played better)


—

EDIT1:

Didn’t want to bore you with the details but example  s are below:

The other day I was playing turbo. I locked in cm safe lane quickly cuz she’s a popular pick. Then this person who was about to pick Zeus safe lane just said that I’m a piece of shit for choosing cm when I knew he’s gonna pick Zeus. (Like ?!?!?)

Later we won a team fight with my ult and knocked down a t2 tower. I told everyone to go push mid, they ended up staying in enemy’s jungle to farm and got killed. They said I ran away when I could have helped but I left to push towers and alerted everyone. 

Then this io just started saying I’m a shit support when I’m the only one warding with kda 7/5/9, I believe his was 2/8/12. he was saying he’s got more assists than me etc.

they pretty much just harassed me for the rest of the game.

—

Another example is that my carry ursa started flaming me for his feed when I did everything I can to help. I ended up leaving his lane and went to help others. 

There was a team fight which I used my ult as cm and the carries just stood there and didn’t fight till the ult was done and I was chasing after the enemy team. My teammates ended up with low health and retreating so I left with them. This mars then asked me why did I run when I had health and mana. Like am I supposed to fight by myself against 4 with no ult? Lol he said he didn’t see me use my ult but he was right there when I did. 

This mars flamed me for the rest of the game and even on public chat which encouraged an enemy to join too. And I had a much better performance and kda than these 3 people.",razzie_bear,17/03/23 05:32:45 PM,https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/11tm7iq/do_you_ever_encounter_a_teammate_that_just_has_a/

DotA2,Possible Bug,"I was playing a game as Muerta. According to her ultimate, "" Muerta can attack ethereal units, but deals no damage to Magic Immune targets."" Was playing against an Axe. I used my ult as Muerta, Axe jumps me with BKB and blademail and I end up destroying myself to Axe's blademail. My question is, if Muerta's ult doesn't damage Magic Immune targets...why am i doing zero damage to Axe but he is somehow reflecting the zero damage I'm doing to him as full damage to me with his blademail. I don't play the game as much as i used to, so maybe blademail is acting normal and its not a bug. But please, inform me on this situation!

DotA2,Two item ideas. Extending Force Staff to also melee and caster users,"Since ranged heros get pike, lets give it as option to both melee and caster heroes-- for sake of versatility and flavor.

It is going to be generally useful item for any melee hero who needs mobility as extension or survivability without compromising carry slot. I think battlefury is a great item which could have an optional upgrade-- non-manditory utility boost, so I decided to give it that.

Mage heroes are most often countered by mobility or so and so, thusly I had in mind that this item is a late game extension; so that the mobile mages wouldnt be too obnoxious. In late any slot is generally well used so this shouldnt matter too much by then. I decided to achieve this by combining already desireable items that already cost somewhat. 


Melee variant:

    Oceanborne Naginata

    Force Staff + Battle Fury + Claymore
    +84 damage
    +10 hp regen
    +8 mana regen

    Force Push: forces target unit forward in range. If casted on self, pushes 25% farther and also creates waves of water to cleave enemies around self during the cast for 150% attack damage.


Caster variant:
   
    Telepathic Spineoid

    Force Staff + Aether Lens + Kaya
    +26 intelligence
    +300 mana
    +2 mana regen
    +16% spell amplification 
    +50% mana regen amp
    +30% spell lifesteal amp
    +225 cast range

With Archon, I feel like it's a never ending hole...

Defensive/offensive wards? Check.

Objective-focused wards? Check.

Stacking? Check.

Winning the lane? If I can't help my lane win lane, I go overload other lane. 9 out of 10 times by mid game, my team tends to have 50% more kills and 1-2 more towers than the other team.

It is mid game onwards that is driving me nuts. I can only smoke/wards so much, if the solo carry doesn't see map and get ganked 1v3, what can I do? When carry builds shit item because they take the game for granted by mid game, what can I do? When carry have BKB but don't use it, what can I do? When all 3 cores pick things that don't combo well with the first 2 picks, what can I do?

My idea that I have never tried yet:

\- Pick support that can transition to core.

DotA2,"Mutiple, irregular disconnects in some recent games","Hello folks,

I experienced some weird disconnects in two of my recent games.
During those games the gamescreen stuck and after like 10s, the game client closes. I can relaunch dota and reconnect. This happens anywhere from within 1min after reconnecting to 5min without any issues, overall about 10-15 times, enough to get an abandon as the cummulative time exceeded 5min.

I'd like to ask if someone experienced similar behaviour, as I wasn't able to find any reason for that.

It happened the first time when party queuing unranked EU with a friend, then three games in a row / in between without any issue, then again in a solo ranked. Time was close to midnight.

I doubt it's my connection, as it is fine normally, and there was no other thing i could associate with the issue. I play on a Linux Laptop. But again, normally it works fine.

Another guy from a discord server mentioned, that he heard of several other people having similar problems.

At first I thought it might be a ddos, but although im a bit into computers and such, the only thing I noticed was a noticeable spike in the upload section of my network graph within performance-task-manager equivalent.

I'm connected via Lan to a wifi-repeater, but removing the cable (so pure wifi) made no difference. Discord (in the first party-queue-game) had no issues while this was happening. No other downloads or progams opened at the time.

Has someone had the same issue recently? Do you think that might be worth reporting to valve? If yes, does someone know where to do that?

Edit: i set IP sharing to ""never"" in steam yesterday, in case its a ddos, will see if that works",J_ester,16/03/23 08:00:30 PM,https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/11ss2ff/mutiple_irregular_disconnects_in_some_recent_games/

DotA2,Games taking too long?,"Recently I have noticed that my matches are getting drawn out more and more. Out of my past 10 games 4 of them have been longer than 60 minutes and 7 out of the 10 have reached 50 minutes. This style of game is extremely exhausting and has killed my interest in playing the game. I feel like a lot of games end up being a turtle fest, where the team that is behind sits under high ground until the winning team takes Roshan and forces a fight. Then the turtle team usually wins the fight and now its the other team turtling. Thus a never ending cycle is born and late game is just extremely exhausting and boring. Is this just a me problem or has anyone else been experiencing this?

DotA2,Why do so many Players abandon Games?,"I'm not the best Dota Player, I only have a little over 160 Matches on my Account, none of them Ranked, just Unranked All Pick. I love playing all sorts of Positions and usually try my best to fit what my Team needs.

I've been noticing that a lot of Players on the enemy Team have been abandoning Games after my Team gets a small Advantage. 

For Example, a few Days ago I played Snapfire on 4. I starated Cookie Level 1 and got my Team 3 Kills by chasing the Enemies down and staying on my Safelane for a bit because they had no Wards. It was 3 to 0 and an Enemy left the Game followed by his entire Team. This also happened in some Games I played Juggernaut and Spirit Breaker in.

Why is it that so many People started abandoning Matches recently? Coming from League I thought that Dota Players had this Mentality of never giving up? That was the case untill this Week when People started leaving a lot more often.

Was the last Patch that bad?",Unknown_Warrior43,16/03/23 07:41:55 PM,https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/11srner/why_do_so_many_players_abandon_games/
DotA2,Meteor Hammer discussion thread,"I've got two opinions on how to address this item:

1) the item no longer stuns, it applies either a root or simply a slow so that it's less effective against heroes but equally effective at pushing waves/towers

2) remove the item completely

To expand on point 2, we all liked clumsy net and other items alike but clearly they weren't great for the game and therefore got removed. I think meteor hammer is the same. It's a silly item that doesn't belong in dota. Sure, to some that might be a controversial take but it's my opinion nonetheless.

This item is clearly hard to balance correctly - either it's useless except for 1-2 heroes or its meta and broken and a ton of heroes buy it. Reworking stats will shift the balance of the item, sure, but just thinking about the concept of the item I really don't like it. If I had it my way the item would be removed. 

The tier 5 meteor blink item can stay though cuz that's unique and badass and whacky for a tier 5 item that only unlocks in hour-long games.",luckytaurus,15/03/23 10:26:03 PM,https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/11rxyzy/meteor_hammer_discussion_thread/

DotA2,"Please, for the love of god, stop picking heroes out of their traditional role and play them as if ur playing them in their actual traditional role.","like i dont get it. if you want to play carry, queue carry and play a carry. why do you queue mid and pick a carry hero/play like a carry hero. im ranting and blowing off some steam from my last game.

&amp;#x200B;

 i had a pos 5 straight up picking tiny and buying 0 wards untill he got his blink at 22 minutes at which point the game was already over because my pos 1 clinkz got fucked on lane with his pos 5 tiny and went to jungle with a javelin. meanwhile my mid muerta, despite knowing that our safelane got fucked and clinkz is jungling with no items, decides to buy midas into maelstrom into bkb(missclicked and wasted his 9 sec bkb upon arrival btw) and finished it off with a 25 minute mask of madness. Farmed the clinkz's triangle stacks, pretty much joined no fights,  made 0 ganks, matter of fact asked me to gank mid for him  3 minutes into the game and missed his Q.

I understand tiny is probably playing his role queue games but where is the logic in picking tiny 5 in your role queue game. like u knnow for a fact ur losing ur lane, why do u not just tryhard your role queue game even if u dont like playing 5.

Anyways sorry for the rant, had to take it out somewhere. But still, im genuinely interested to know why you would want to play mid when u want to go farm mode",Avako1999,19/03/23 06:04:30 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/11v2bdm/please_for_the_love_of_god_stop_picking_heroes/

DotA2,Another recalibration thread (but hear me out),"Sup, humans

&amp;#x200B;

So...I've been playing DotA since DotA1. The first time the MMR system came out I had 4.5\~4.7k mmr while proplayers were 5\~5.3k (as far as I can remember, cuz 10+ years, anyway I used to find them constantly on matchmaking). I stopped playing a few months after the system came out and then came back to play in 2018. Then, I was considered Ancient (I-IV if I remember correctly). Sure, all good. I stopped playing. Then, I stopped again. Last week I came back after five years without playing and...what the f\*\*\* I'm Herald III and I got 320 MMR. What in the god's heaven happened? Is this a common thing now? I lost all my motivation to play ff.",Hiperlicious,14/03/23 01:26:11 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/11qfr23/another_recalibration_thread_but_hear_me_out/
DotA2,Dotabuff statistics are misleading players,"If a player looks at [https://www.dotabuff.com/heroes/trends](https://www.dotabuff.com/heroes/trends) they might see the following row:

Death prophet, start winrate 46.60%, current winrate 48.29%, change +1.69%.

&amp;#x200B;

Reading this, they might reasonably believe that death prophet's wr has increased by 1.69%. this is incorrect. The actual winrate percentage increase is 48.29/46.6 = 1.036 -&gt; 3.65% - that's 214% more than the score that dotabuff reports! 

However, the percentage \*point\* increase in winrate is 1.69: 48.29 - 46.6 = 1.69 \*p.p\*

This mixup on behalf of dotabuff could potentially confuse players and lead them to draw incorrect conclusions about hero trends.

I reached out to dotabuff about this earlier this week, but they have not responded. Therefore, I felt a need to bring the issue out to the public.",dota_stats_throwaway,16/03/23 02:08:12 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/11s48kd/dotabuff_statistics_are_misleading_players/

DotA2,Intended Ethereal &amp; BKB interaction,"Pugna can cast decrepify on himself or an ally &amp; they can BKB making them totally immune to both physical and magical damage.

The same applies to Eblade which is the bigger problem.

But it doesn't work with Ghost scepter or Leshrac's Nihilism or Necrophos's Ghost Shroud (if they use BKB they lose the ethereal buff)

As far as I can remember wasn't the Ethereal state supposed to be removed by BKB?

DotA2,Muerta's ult should do damage through BKB,"It kinda sucks that all of muerta's abilities are countered by BKB, and she can't even deal damage with right clicks even though two of her abilities scale with right click damage.  She doesn't have great tankiness, escape, or burst without a lot of items. Her crowd control is mediocre because 2 spells are based on right click, so she feels like she doesn't fit in any role really well.

leagueoflegends,Nashor Tooth used to have ability haste then it was removed few seasons ago now its added back again,"&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

While it has more stats to gold value, 3200 G is still a huge amount not to mention that its purpose serves a few select champs \[who benefit from AS + AP\]

Popular users of Nashors tooth: Azir \[underperforms with it rn tho\], Gwen, Kayle, Kata, Teemo, Shyvana and Ekko

&amp;#x200B;

It could even become the #1 main build for some users like Mordekaiser \[ he already performs well with it\] or someone like Neeko who also boasts a high WR with it but it is often not picked in her build. both of them LOVE ability haste

Kai'sa might even appreciate it more as she made use of Nashor as a situational item and appreciates the ability haste as well

Someone like Katarina might not appreciate the Ability Haste for example while Ekko would make a good use of it

leagueoflegends,Idea for Yuumi Balance,Now I just want it stated I’m not very good with purposing balance changes or tweaking numbers or anything like that so I’ll leave that for you smarter folks to discuss. But I was thinking about her rework and thought of something that might work. What if her untargetability only lasted a certain amount of time then she gets kicked off and the ability goes on cooldown? And what if her abilities differ from when she’s attached to someone and she’s not? Like her healing or shielding or whatever is amplified when attached to someone compared to when she’s not. Maybe hitting her q while not attached could reduce the cooldown of her w. Idk just throwing something out there.

They pop their Twitch link in the chat and rambling about something that the matchmaking is rigged and that they always gets bad teams that make them lose. 

As ADC they continue to pick Blitzcrank and just starts trolling and inting on mid. I checked in Porofessor and they're Iron IV with no LP. I also checked their Twitch and they claim something about exposing matchmaking manipulation in the description of their Twitch stream. They continue this behaviour on their stream so it definitely isn't the first time they did this. Exactly the same behaviour as in also picking Blitzcrank either on mid or ADC.

leagueoflegends,HUD shows abilities ready but they are actually on cooldown,"During an earlier game, I (playing Zyra) tried to cast my E and ult again and again but they wouldn't cast.

The issue:

* After having made sure that my keyboard works fine and after some testing in the practice tool, I checked the [replay](https://youtu.be/em6FARrF3m8), only to find out that my abilities weren't casted because **they were actually on cooldown**.
   * I have no in-game screenshot to prove this, but at the time the HUD showed that they were all ready, which was why I jumped into a fight. Unfortunately, from the replay, it just looks like I made an extraordinary bad decision.

Similar issues from other players:

* I found [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/KaynMains/comments/szi2ca/ran_into_a_pretty_bad_bug_this_morning_r_showed/) from a year ago by a Kayn player experiencing the same issue. However, I suspect that it might not be limited to Zyra or Kayn. 
* In [Patch 13.3](https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-pl/news/game-updates/patch-13-3-notes/), Riot said they fixed the following bug. These could be related.

&gt;Fixed a bug that caused ally's summoner spell/ultimate indicators to show them as READY, despite them actually being on cooldown.

This has only happened twice out of the 200+ games I have played so far (both times on Zyra), but I have only started playing again recently (since Season 12/13) though. It would've been a big issue if I were playing a ranked game.

leagueoflegends,Best item 1vs1 lv3?,"I'm having a casual tournament of 1vs1 in the aram map, first kill wins so I can't buy more than the initial 1100 (i think that number) gold.

I'm planning on playing Darius or Teemo, What item should I buy?",Healthy-Ad7380,17/03/23 06:09:50 PM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11tmw8j/best_item_1vs1_lv3/
leagueoflegends,Potential player swaps in the future,"I really think Beryl to DK would be super dope reunion with him and Deft, but also Canyon/Showmaker roam synergy he had with Damwon, and the great bot lane synergy he had with DRX at the same time, and Canna has been playing great so wouldn't change him. (not saying Kellin is bad but I love to see when Beryl is at his best vs Keria)

As far as LCS goes I think a cool roster that would be more of a challenge to the league than DIG would, (if some players don't make playoffs etc) Revenge/Solo top, River jg, Maple mid, Wildturtle adc, Winsome supp 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyone else have any fun ideas or opinions of what a interesting/good roster or player swap would be to see? This post is total personal opinion and what I'd wanna see personally but other people could totally have better ideas than me 110% I don't doubt that!",Static_Wolf95,16/03/23 04:34:15 PM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11so8is/potential_player_swaps_in_the_future/
leagueoflegends,Weak mental,"Why is it that a lot of league players will roast you all game, then when one of your teammates leave, they have the audacity to complain that he had a ""weak mental"". I feel like a lot of players do not understand that no one I repeat no one, enjoys playing a game where they are constantly bereded and insulted all game by randoms on the internet. And for those of you who will claim"" what do you expect, it's league"", understand that you are adding to the problem by having no desire to fix it and classifying toxicity as ""part of the experience"". At this point the community is getting to the point where i want to quit after years of playing. I hate seeing that despite the fact it isnt even happening to me.",Blackeshadow,17/03/23 09:16:24 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11tcx67/weak_mental/

leagueoflegends,"Jungle pet leaves bush, revealing itself to enemies","I had a game where I was doing a lane gank top lane, swept all the bushes and it was all unwarded. but the enemy top laner somehow knew I was there. I watch the replay back and they saw my jungle pet leave the bush and that is how they knew I was there. Is this a bug or intentional?

leagueoflegends,Genuine question: how are you supposed to rank up?,"I’ve been playing for a few years now and am not the best player but am completely hard stuck silver. I have a 65% WR across 200 games this season but am losing 25 LP with every loss and only gaining 10-15LP with a win? I understand (as much as one can) the MMR system but why is my MMR so low when my win rate is so high? I win the majority of my games but then have any LP game wiped out by the 25% of games where I get a support without a support item, or just a huge gap elsewhere on the map!

Am I really supposed to be winning 80% of the games to realistically level up? Because that is IMPOSSIBLE in the complete RNG hellhole that is low ELO 😂",kermit_ninja,13/03/23 07:28:51 PM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11q73x2/genuine_question_how_are_you_supposed_to_rank_up/

leagueoflegends,Why do i play with so many unrankeds?,"Hey, my account is Level 314 and i am currently gold 1, played like 120 games this season.   
So my account is not a new one.  
I was just wondering, why i play with or against so many unranked accounts atm.  
When i take a look at my last games 7 games, i had 7 Unranked Accs i have never had that many.  
It all started when i was in Platin Promo.  
And also many accs were low level like level 40, but already had a rank.  
IMO the problem with those accs is, that they do not rly care about getting banned, they will just buy or make a new one. So those games were giga toxic and some unrakneds went afk for no reason.  
Another thing that i noticed is, that i can rly much report feedbacks.

leagueoflegends,"bad soloq day / practice day (irelia, midtop, platinum 3)","TL;DR: If anyone has any advice to help me keep going for improving even though I do nearly anything for a lot of years now, Im happy about it, feel free to ping me.

&amp;#x200B;

I had a full day of playing soloq and played as focused as possible  i gained 25 lp in total, means I made progress of1 win I focused solely on learning new things I got impatient and take breaks, soothened my mental and kept pushing Now my day is finished And the last game I played was on my 2nd account which is even a bit lower I didnt play well there either And now I feel a bit bad, even though I know I learned something but did I? Will my brain learn from those teamfights, that I had to keep my spells a bit more preserved? did my brain learn to push for those Minion Qs that were necessary to live Did my brain learn from the positive dives, kills and decisions I made? I don't know All I can do is trust trust my brain trust in the process  Even though this process goes on for more than 5 years now but I didnt play a lot of games in total Sure, I played a lot today And days like this happen at least 3 times a week but thats not 7 times a week But I cant play all days like this, a lot like this, focused and refreshed with a good mindset is it possible? No bc I cant finance a lifestyle like this Am I only platinum and does it feel even bad to keep going and does it appear better to just give up bc it's very unlikely Ill reach my goals due to them being so hard and me struggling with a simple MMR like that? but will I keep going? Yes ofc, this is the only thing I want and Im happy about this. Very happy about my decisions and what I chose for me, for my life. What Ill do now is take some notes close my eyes relax and call it a day.

even though i feel like I wanna cry.

but I wont! I dont need to. Its okay. I played a lot and did my best And tomorrow, Ill do that again and I love myself for that.

leagueoflegends,Two AP Bruiser Item Ideas (Intended for Melee).,"(EDIT): Clarification: These are Legendary items, not Mythic.

**#1:**

**Martial Dominant Shield: 3000 gold**

**350 HP**

**55  AP**

**20  AH**

Fiendish codex (900g) + Giants belt (900g) + Amplifying tome (435g)

\-Unique Passive: CQC: For each second engaged in ""close quarters"" combat against champions within 300 range, gain a stack for 3 seconds, max 4 stacks.

\-At max stacks, become empowered for 5 seconds, gaining bonus resistances equal to 2.5% bonus health, 20 ability power, and 6% bonus move speed towards champions within 300 range.  Empowered state refreshes every second while within 300 range of enemy champions.

**#2:**

**Martial Dominant Blade: 3200 gold**

**350 HP**

**65  AP**

**10 magic penetration**

**20  AH**

Fiendish codex (900g) + Hextech Alternator (1050g) + Amplifying tome (435g)

\-Unique Passive: CQC: For each second engaged in ""close quarters"" combat against champions within 300 range, gain a stack for 3 seconds, max 4 stacks.

\-At max stacks, change combat stance for 5 seconds. While in this stance, basic attacks against champions deal 35 (+15% bonus AP) bonus magic damage On-Hit. Additionally, this item gains 150 bonus health, ability power equal to 2% bonus health, and gains 6% bonus move speed towards champions within 300 range. Stance time refreshes every second while within 300 range of enemy champions.

&amp;#x200B;

So uh...some ideas for items intended to reward AP bruisers for sticking close to their targets, the condition being, a requirement to remain close to the target for prolonged periods of time can also leave them vulnerable.

(EDIT): One of the goals was to keep the AP values low enough that, aside from being intended for melee champions, the items would hopefully not be susceptible to poaching because they wouldn't be worth the purchase for anyone else.

[Pantheon's W range is 600 so imagine this circle reduced by half and that's about the range needed to stay within during combat to stack each item's passive.](https://preview.redd.it/wqiimlubkcoa1.png?width=1182&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=a5fbbbd2a5f0d64afe5e8d03daea2bb38a0a0cb5)",BasedPantheon,18/03/23 02:30:26 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11tzgge/two_ap_bruiser_item_ideas_intended_for_melee/

leagueoflegends,AP items,"So lately I have been thinking about the dilemma of ap items that have health (Rylai's, Demonic, arguably rod) originally designed to be item for ap juggernauts like Mordekaiser getting used by other mages such as Ryze, who end up with the same amount of health as juggernauts, whilst dealing 5 times as much dmg. And unlike ad items, where u can control damage based items with bonus ad, and fighter based items with flat ad and health, u can't do the same to ap items, since all of ap champs are designed to start with very little and scale late game. My personal possible solutions on this -

1. Remove health from ap items entirely, keep the ones with passive so specific ranged champs can't use them and instead add health scaling for bonus ap only on melee champs (as passive). Bad thing about this - game gets a little messy.
2. Cut health from ap items and add a sort of Rabadons for ap juggernauts - with some combination of ***Base*** health and bonus ap. Bad thing about this - some battle mages with high base health may end up abusing (Ryze I am looking at you)
3. Mana. Lately I have been feeling as if Mana for most of the champions is a very available resource late game, which in a way makes it so actually buying mana isn't as important. Slapping on a tier and avoiding using ur W during first 5-6 minutes usually makes it very hard to not have mana. So  my solution regarding health - the spells of ranged ap champs should have added up mana cost, and items that are specifically designed for ranged champions should get the same amount of mana added to them, Making it so they have they have access to the same amount of spells as right now. This makes so mage players really feel nothing on their mana, unless they buy health items which will heavily cut down their sustain on abilities. Bad thing about this - because low elo cs and gold income is so slow, mages are suddenly going to have way different win rates in low elo and high elo.

What's ur take on this? Any that u like, any that u don't, any that u might add, or do you not agree with the problem at all? I am open to all feedback

leagueoflegends,Ziggs in Aram is a joke. PSA don’t pick him.,"Ziggs “balance” in aram is that he does 80% dmg. He takes 120% dmg. And he starts the game with negative 20 ability haste. What in the actual fig-newtons is going on with aram balance, no one who balances this game mode actually plays it &amp; it’s beyond evident. In this example you’re going against a kindred. Who is buffed, to 110% dmg and takes 90% dmg. Her crits have a 30% dmg increase to you as ziggs, and your bombs do 30% less dmg to her. How in the world is this considered a good quality gameplay improvement? She can right click you and walk away from the keyboard and you’ll still die. She can right click you and go pop some ramen in the microwave for all she cares. This is getting ridiculously out of hand. I think I speak for the majority of aram players when we say, we need to see these beyond egregious champion changes in champ select. I’d rather get ass blasted by a normal ziggs or sona then load into a game and realize I’m a glorified cannon minion for the next 15-25 minutes. Pathetic.

leagueoflegends,My path to fourth place in Tier 4 Clash,"This humble tale starts on a warm and humid evening at 8:07 PM when our top laner informs us he will not be able to partake in Clash. We rush to find a replacement, wait in queue for less time than expected, and meet our first opponent by 8:40.

A moment of hesitation hits us all as a team consisitng of 1 70% WR diamond2 player, 2 silver players, 1 bronze and 1 iron player faces us. All five of the enemy players attempt to add our teammate with the most feminine name. ""Hi uwu im going to be cheating so my friends can win sry in advance.. :3"". Our midlaner's PC crashes 10 mins in and we unsurprisingly shit stomp the enemy team.

Our midlaner's PC determined that the league of legends client used too many resources and would not launch for the rest of the night. While we arrange for someone else to take our midlaner's account and play on a working computer, our top laner and first pick does not load into champ select for the second game due to another client error. We ban 0 champions and recieve a random champion, gangplank. Our first pick begins to restart his client. The enemy team picks their onetricks, our replacement for our midlaner has still not logged in.

Our second pick is another random champion. Annie. Our yorick one trick pony logs in and states that he can in fact first time Annie in our clash game. We lose to the enemy's unbanned onetricks by narrow margins, unlucky. Queue silver scrapes we are going to our final game. 

The third game comes, no funny business, we get to pick AND ban in champ select, our plat1 toplaner playing on our midlaner's account gets his yorick one trick as our enemies dont expect it. He solo loses to a silver player. Oopsies! The loading screen tip informing my top laner that Jax’s favorite food is eggs was not enough to contribute to successfully counter playing the recently reworked champion. What started as an exciting evening looking forward the revival of clash turns into a stunning success with few mishaps that may be improved on in the future. How were y’all’s first clashes of season 2023? 

Overall, I would like to thank my mom and my dad, as well as riot for allowing me to achieve such a prestigious award- fourth place in tier 4 clash. As for future aspirations, I hope to perform on the worlds stage next and I hope that my team will be able to pick or ban more effectively in the future. 

On a more serious note, why does the league of legends client take up more resources than rust, minecraft, and the actual game running all at the same time?",BigBrainBuffoon,12/03/23 01:32:25 PM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11p6ewv/my_path_to_fourth_place_in_tier_4_clash/

leagueoflegends,Support looking for advice to get out of iron 3-4 seasons in a row,"Hello all! Before you read - I don't want to hear ""just play a different role"". That is not an option due to some factors.

I'm a hard-stuck iron-bronze support. Started off playing Janna, soon enough understood that aint gonna cut it. So I moved to Brand and Morgana. I'd say those 3 are my mains, based on the opponents and availability ( e.g. I will always play Morgana into Thresh or Veigar, or Brand when our team has enough shields and other team has nothing I should shield from, but we need that extra passive damage. And Janna is just useless in my ELO). I am decent at some other champs, but not to the point of freely playing them in ranked. I 'd like to think that I have 1 purely healer/shielder, one purely attack and 1 that is a bit of everything.

I 've been told by some plat players that I don't deserve to be where I am ( which has gotten to my head a lot :D ). I ward like mad, I've been told my map awareness is extremely good given my rank. Hell, I can carry a weak ADC to win the lane, if I have to. There are games where my split-pushing and wave-clearing wins us the game, simply becaues I know the other team can't group if they have to defend 3 lanes at once. But mu teams tend to think I'm just a bad support, because supposedly all I should do is ward and shield them blindly.

I've been putting off doing ranked this season as I see no point in it anymore. All I do is get frustrated. I play only solo queue ( no friends :D) or flex, also queue alone.

leagueoflegends,Honor system is broken. It's impossible to climb back to level 2 honor from level 0 until the end of the split.,"Greetings. First of all, I do not condone toxic behaviour and I'm not here to complain about getting chat restricted unrightfully. I deserved both chat restrictions that were applied to my account this season and I think they were beneficial for me as a player, right now I have the chat disabled by my own choice and the games already feel better. 

&amp;nbsp;

Getting back to Honor level 2 after your punishment ends feels incredibly slow with too many checkpoints in the way, this was hard in the previous seasons, but it looks impossible nowadays with the new changes to the ranked season. The ambiguity of the system makes it even worse, there are no exact timeframes or a minimum of required games until you reach the next checkpoint, no transparency either, meaning you can't see your progress towards a checkpoint until it already happens. From the League's support FAQ page regarding the Honor system, you find out that the only way to level up is by playing games, not grefing nor flaming in chat and you will see some progression in the coming weeks and months. Also, if you get a lot of honors from non premade teammates, you get a ""slight bonus"" towards progression. Again, no quantifiable details, only ambiguity which leaves room for a lot of interpretation. What does *slight* exactly mean? Is it a 10% bonus towards progression? Perhaps more or less than that? Do I need 5,10,20,50 honors from teammates to reach a checkpoint faster? If I play 5 games a day, how many weeks until I reach a checkpoint? What about 10 daily games? Will I get there faster or at the same rate? Everything is reduced to your own interpretation of the system without any clear indications, the result is madness. We need a clear guideline of what to expect and a more detailed approximation based on each one's circumstances. For example, you play 5 games per day? Then it will take you about 5 weeks, but if you get a certain number of honors from teammates, you can get there in 4 weeks. At least, it would be nice to see a progression bar that shows you how close you are towards reaching the next checkpoint based on how many games you played or honors you received to give you an idea of where you are and how long will it take to get to the next checkpoint.

&amp;nbsp;

Another problem is the number of checkpoints required to reach certain levels. In total there are 9 checkpoints you need to pass in order to get back to honor level 2 from 0.

* 1 checkpoint to unlock the honor again;
* 4 checkpoints until level 1 (checkpoints 1 2 &amp; 3 + another checkpoint to reach level 1);
* 4 checkpoints until level 2 (same as the previous bullet point).

&amp;nbsp;

Given that the season used to last from mid-January until mid-Novemeber, this is equal to 10 months of play. In theory if you were to get a chat restrict in February, you would get there with about 1 checkpoint per month looking at the current system, but as far as I remember (please correct me if I'm wrong) during seasons previous to season 12, the lowest honor level was level 1, meaning you only needed 5 checkpoints to get back to level 2, which was doable for most of the people, even if you got a punishment before Summer. The problem is that now with 2 splits, the first split ends after 6 months, leaving you to pass 9 checkpoints in less than 6 months which is impossible. From 11th of January (since the season started) until 18th of July (when the first split ends) there are 27 weeks. If it were for you to get a chat restrict in the first day of the season, you would need to get 1 checkpoint every 3 weeks just to barely make it back to level 2 until the split ends. **This means that you have less than 3 weeks for each checkpoint if you get a restriction at a later date, which is impossible given how the current progression of the honor system works.**

&amp;nbsp;

From my own experience, in the seasons 10 and 11 I received one chat restrict in each season, around February/March. It's been few years since then, but on average, it took about 1 month for some checkpoints and for others about 1/2 months. Can't recall if there were any checkpoints that required more or less time. Usually by the end of August/September, I was back to honor level 2, plenty of time left before season ended. 

&amp;nbsp;

I am writing this, because even if you show signs of progress and reform along the season, you can't possibly get back to level 2 in time to get your end of the split rewards. I'm talking about the summoner icons, the victorious skin and the lobby banner. In the past, the system was more forgiving, granting you a chance to climb back the honor levels and get your rewards, nowadays it became harsher and harsher making it impossible to do so. As of right now, it is impossible for me at least to get back to level 2 before the split ends. Sadly, I feel like Riot forgot to tweak the honor system to fit with the new the structure of the ranked season.

&amp;nbsp;

leagueoflegends,Rakan &amp; Xayah Custom Recall Trade-off follow-up?,"So, I believe it has been enough time to ask this again: Where can we learn about these changes and trade-offs?

After the general distress this caused, it was said in the answer on PBE specifically, we could expect a better job informing about trade-offs and what is acceptable or not... But that would imply the player base knows anything about these trade-offs in the first place so... Was there ever a place where it was stated what is happening? Where are the resources going and why?

I ask because early in the year it was confirmed that Reddemed Rakan &amp; Xayah will come and they had the custom recall in WR. Will this be removed from the port too?

I've come here after trying on Twitter and the PBE forum because I don't know where else to find this info or where else to ask about this, there has not been any news on Twitter, the only answer was a response to a PBE thread, no dev logs, not even a hidden weird Tiktok announcement.

I don't believe keeping quiet will just make people forget or get less worried about it, at most, it will make more mains wary and distrustful of what is happening after, not only promising transparency after the cinematic disaster, but also compromising with mains Xayah &amp; Rakan since Arcana would get the customized recall and, of course, not delivering it.

Again, it would be easier to understand what is happening if the info is out before taking the decision so you can learn about the general feelings of the mains. It would be less confusing for us players and less difficult to handle for the ones in charge of feedback, even knowing if there is a time frame for the answer or a specific channel that we should watch out for answers will suffice.

After all this time, I would hope there is at least a little note somewhere about this and how this contrasts the feedback-data compilation. If so, where is it, and is there a way to easily access these notes and trade-offs? Especially for the people that aren't on Reddit.

I really hope there is an answer.

(I also hope the answer doesn't has anything to do with the events on CN server vs the lack of events on Global Servers. I don't think that would be very good for the health and general state of the game)

leagueoflegends,Can someone explain me how LP works?,"I have been playing this game since before Season 1 and i really dont understand what is happening. I have a 55% winrate in P3 and lose 25-26 LP while gaining 20-21 LP.

How can I be losing so much more than gaining with such a winrate? It was even at the beginning of the season then i went on a 5 game loss streak and since then it seems my MMR is completely fucked. It makes climbing so incredible frustrating.",derog63,15/03/23 05:49:51 PM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11rrq81/can_someone_explain_me_how_lp_works/
leagueoflegends,This is how LFL stands looks with one week left in the regular stage. No team has locked their playoffs spot yet.,"This post is completely inspired by u/Dsalgueiro's post on CBLOL.

[Here is a screenshot of the standings after 16 out of 18 days of regular season.](https://i.imgur.com/DTQiUYq.png)

You can see that with only 2 days left in the stage, NO team has locked their slot in playoffs, and only one team is certain to be locked out of the Playoffs stage : Izi Dream

Twitter user [Tashiqi](https://twitter.com/Tashiqi) made a recap of every team's chances for every possible outcome in the regular season : 

https://i.imgur.com/KAo1hki.png

Here goes a quick recap for each team that can still have a spot, ranked by their playoffs chances :

* **LDLC OL** The team that won both split in 2022 is back in their first place in 2023, however their roster is wildly different with two LFL rookies : ***White*** (jungler) and ***Zoelys*** (support) who are both really interesting. ***Jeskla*** is also part of this team which is very likely to go to playoffs in spite of being in a 3 games losing streak.

* **GO** (*formerly Gamers Origin*) This LFL superteam has *alledgedly* the biggest budget for their roster with ***Toucouille***, ***Ragner*** and ***Jezu***, three players that are LCS/LEC ready or already proven. They've had a rocky start and are now in the lead with LDLC OL.

* **Aegis** A newly formed team from french twitch personalities *Shaunz*, *DFG*, and *mistermv*(who just hosted *Speedons*, a speedrun marathon on Twitch that raised 1.25 million euros for Doctors of the World last weekend). Former LDLC midlaner ***Eika*** and former KC support ***Hantera*** are part of this new project, and are on a 5-games winning streak, biggest streak during this split.

* **Vitality Bee** Vit B. has been in playoffs every time since summer 2020 and is likely to keep this trend. A combination of veterans (***Jactroll***, ***Innaxe***) and LFL rookies (***Daglas***, ***PatkicaA***) which make this eastern european roster a really solid contender for this split.

* **BDS Academy** Another big budget LFL team with jungler ***Maxi*** and former LEC players ***Reeker*** and ***xMatty***, which considerably improved since their respective LEC splits, they are now much more confident in their skills and know their own forces.

* **Gameward** This team was expected to be bottom-tier, and 6 weeks in, GW was 8-3. They've been in a rough state since their 0-3 superweek. Jungler ***Eckas*** is also a LFL rookie and pretty impressive, ***Badlulu***, former trackmania player and former Mirage Elyandra toplaner has been having a great performance this spring and has the most MVP awards in the league for now.

* **Solary** Only ***Steeelback*** stayed from their precedent roster, this new roster has great individualities with ***Melonik*** having star-making performances. For the first time ever, they have a positive record against their greatest rivals Karmine Corp by beating them twice this split.

* **BK Rog** Newly formed team that acquired a slot during the offseason. Only team that imported players from Korea with toplaner ***Howling*** and ADC ***Trigger***. A rocky start from them but back on their feet with big wins against LDLC, GW and BDSA in their last three games.

* **Karmine Corp** Most likely the reason you're reading this post, Karmine Corp had changes in three roles : jungler, adc and support. Their french core ***Cabochard-Skeanz-Saken*** is not as dominating as expected, and former EG adc ***Kaori*** with former Heretics support ***whiteinn*** are good individually. This great roster on paper has not found their groove quickly, but they've been having good games recently and can still hope in a miracle run.

These recaps are obviously not complete at all, I'm sorry if there is a bit of inconsistency or bias in these, some teams have great stories as well, but for the sake of brevity I have to *only* present them in a few words.

This is the first time that I watch a regular season where no one has completely secured their playoffs spot going in the last week of the regular season.

Wednesday 18:00 CET, the final week starts with **VitB** vs **LDLC** on french stream *otplol_*. The english cast from NorthernArena was not renewed for 2023.

leagueoflegends,Knight's Vow is still classified as an armor item despite the recipe changing over two years ago,"(Title referring to the stat filters when viewing items on the ""All Items"" tab)

For a likely explanation, Knight's Vow used to build out of a Chain Vest but this was changed in season 10, patch 10.23 back in November 2020. You could argue the item gives physical damage reduction as part of the passive, which maybe could qualify it as an armor item. However this same passive reduces magic damage but the item doesn't appear in shop as a Magic Resistance item.",MattRazz,18/03/23 01:48:04 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11ty9qo/knights_vow_is_still_classified_as_an_armor_item/

leagueoflegends,"Just give yuumi partial invincibility, it cant be that hard","So yuumi is the worst champion ever, and I dont think its that hard to detect the problem. She buffs, from the complete safety of invincibility. So how about.... we change that? I know, insane revolutionary idea. I dont think we should completely remove it, because then she might aswell be deleted, but simply making her invincibility limited would fix 90% of the problem. For example, after using x ability, idk which would fit best, it could even be after casting x amount of abilities or a bar a bit like gnar. After which she has 1 second to voluntarily jump off, or be shunted off her ally, then there is a cooldown before she can jump back on, probably somewhere between 3-7 seconds. Boom.

Am I missing something here? Because I really dont see how this whole yuumi thing is so much of a problem, her champion idea is flawed, so take away part of it.",NovaNomii,13/03/23 11:47:31 PM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11qd8ip/just_give_yuumi_partial_invincibility_it_cant_be/

leagueoflegends,The main reason why abyssal mask is bad and how to make it good,"Abyssal mask is an extremely niche item, where if your team has a lot of magic damage(also preferably including the champion you're playing, which is usually the case since most tanks does primarily magic damage) you would want to buy this item to boost your teams magic damage. In theory this item makes a lot of sense, the issue however is if you are so magic heavy that you are considering buying this item to boost your teams damage in team fights, the flat magic pen does very little because the enemy team will probably have at least 1 magic resist item on every champion by the time you finish this item and really start applying the passive in team fights.

Furthermore tanks have worse economy generally since they prioritize sitting in lane farming for items less than other classes to help their team with their cc, making the abyssal mask completion come online later in the game.

Abyssal mask in the games where its meant to be bought(fairly uncommon because so many conditions has to be met for it to be purchased, being a tank buying it, team does probably around 60-70% magic damage, and enemy has magic damage, but not enough so that u need to buy a fon to survive) is that it gets outscaled really quickly.

The only way to make this item in its current iteration worth buying and sacrificing delaying/not buying fon is to make the passive reduce % mr instead of flat, or just make it become more gold efficent, where you would mostly really only buy it for the stats it gives.",Zaparapapa,12/03/23 06:25:42 PM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11pbaiz/the_main_reason_why_abyssal_mask_is_bad_and_how/

leagueoflegends,I made It! From Iron to Silver!!,"Hi guys! Everyone says ""u can't get out from Iron"". So i decided to grind ranked Solo/Duo on Jungle. 1 Week later i just promoted to Bronze IV (started with MMR +7LP, and -33LP lolz), then my friends says ""yea, but u can't get Silver :D""

Soo, that was a long trip, i learned a looot of playing in Jungle and i really feel im playing better. To you who wants like me Silver IV after hard stuck in Iron or Bronze, i can say one thing that may help you! Don't just focus on LP - focus on improving. Im sure u are mad now but hey, i started this season with +7 and -33, sooo everything is possible! Just have good mental and don't focus only on your stats, if u are feeded - then good but ur mates are not, so they cant do anything, so the one more fast tip is to dont take every kill from ganks, beacuse ur mates need gold too to buy items! And ofc the objectives, if u want to take drake, just gank ur botlane, push enemy to the tower and ping 20 times on drake, if u want herald just play for top! Seems easy? It is! Really guys, carrying games in this ELO as Jungler is not hard! Just have a good mental!

leagueoflegends,Kayle Vs AP Varus,"&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ci4no84fizna1.jpg?width=988&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=058147c250ae9bfae816a41a8b9a0c8d70fd6c2e

I know this isn't new information, but I recently faced an AP Varus top lane, and after looking into his kit I was surprised at just **how much Varus and Kayle have in common.** And just how much better Varus seems to be relatively. Let's compare: (Not exhaustive, just some highlights at what they have in common and how they differ)

||Varus|Kayle|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Ranged|Level 1|Level 6|
|MR|30 + 1.3 per lvl|22 + 1.3 per lvl|
|On-hit bonus|30% AP ratio (W passive)|25% AP ratio (E passive)|
|Passive AS steroid|On minion kill gain AS 20%  (+ 20% **bonus** AS)  for up to 11 second (based on level). Increased to 40% (+ 40% bonus AS) upon scoring a champion kill.|6% AS per stack, up to 30%   (+ 5% per 100 AP). Lasts 5 seconds.|
|Low HP execute ability|(W + Q)  combo is empowered to deal **6% − 21%** (based on level and Q channel time) of the target's missing health bonus magic damage. Additionally, each stack of Blight deals 3-5% (+ 2.5% per 100 AP) of the target's **maximum** health.|(E) **8 - 10%** (+ 1.5% per 100 AP) of target's missing health|
|Poke|(Q) **Up to 1595 range** (based on channel time). Also detonates blight stacks.|(Q)  900 range, but can hit targets behind initial target. Slow + AR/MR debuff.|
|Self peel|(E) 25 / 30 / 35 / 40 / 45%  Slow|(Q)  26 / 32 / 38 / 44 / 50% slow (W) MS buff|

To break it down- Varus starts off ranged, his MR doesn't suck, gets more AS from passive, he has better AP on-hit ratio, his execute combo can do 21% missing health damage!!!! On top of max HP dmg from detonating blight stacks, and with a couple items his burst potential is explosive. R+W+Q combo can easily one-shot, no need to rely on a frontline. He has better poke than Kayle, wayyy better burst, and even better sustained damage with passive after champion kill.

Aside from their ultimate, they really do have a lot in common. I know there's more nuance to it, like Kayle's AA do wave damage, Varus is much more immobile than Kayle, but I think it's worth looking at just how relatively underpowered Kayle is compared to Varus in a lot of ways.

I think Kayle isn't in a great spot right now and could use some updates. We're seeing things like LT nerf in 13.6, as well as the ""buff"" for Nashors tooth which will really help a champ like Varus who relies more on AH and abilities, but is actually a nerf for Kayle who is AA focused and would rather have the item cost less.",noobvad3r,16/03/23 04:54:05 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11s8xrv/kayle_vs_ap_varus/

leagueoflegends,A small change that could improve Top Lane satisfaction,"Bot lane snowballing needs to be toned down. A way to improve top lane satisfaction would be to buff 1v1 tower dives and nerf 1v2 tower dives by making turrets do more damage if two or more people from the enemy team are near the turret. That way top laners can still be rewarded for winning their lane solo and can snowball their leads a bit more and bot lane is less likely to snowball out of control into 2v8ing the game.

Post durability patch I've found snowballing top lane to be much more difficult than before while bot lane tends to snowball way too hard (d1/masters elo fwiw). Currently solo lane skill expression doesn't convert into leads as much as it should imo.",Vulsynx,14/03/23 05:38:38 PM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11r1rqh/a_small_change_that_could_improve_top_lane/

I was diamond since 2014 in every season I played however it feels a bit weird atm, I am around high gold low plat right now playing jungle. Some people (especially top laners) seem to run it down when I touch their wave. I will just give two examples but in 20 games or so it happened like 5 times.
Eg 1: Both top laners got ignite, I gank and both dies, wave is in the middle so I just shove it to the enemy turret because it's free resources for me, meanwhile I'm getting spam pinged by my top lane to back off when he's still dead and when he respawned he just killed my camps for next 5-6 mins and then actually run it down 3 times until we ff.
Eg 2: I'm already at bot, our top is walking to bot from base, 1st enemy turret is up, wave is in the middle killing each other, I shove the wave and our top went apeshit with pings, got troll items and never came to any team fights.

leagueoflegends,Team Builder: League's Forgotten Queue,"League had a mode for only about 2 years where you would pick your champ and role, then queue and get matched with a team. It was replaced with the current Draft mode, which is where the queue for your role method was implemented. The upcoming Quick Play queue seems to be a new iteration on that idea where you can expand to multiple choices of Champ + Role combinations.

Honestly, Team Builder was a decent idea, and I am happy to see an iteration of it that would forgo some of the issues the queue had by adding the option of back up positions. I feel that making alternate roles an option, with the understanding that your queue time may be increased (basically that Tyler1 idea for single role queue) would be a healthy decision.

I wanna hear how everyone else feels about this, and how successful it will be. It's hard to judge right now, with it only going into testing soon, but it seems an interesting idea.",Ketaku,19/03/23 01:11:20 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11utynh/team_builder_leagues_forgotten_queue/

leagueoflegends,Realizing what made league fun,"I have always played League competitively and had fun but always felt that something was missing.  


Yesterday as usual taking a break from ranked. I played lots of arams and was given champs like galio, gnar, alistar etc. I was spamming emotes and never played these champs being an ad main for 10 years focusing on competitive ranked only. In those games I had many funny situations where in a teamfight my team dies and the enemy team chases after me. she does her Q and i dodge everything by walking and when she pressed her knock up skill which was right afer her q shots i simply stood still and that even made the enemy Taliyah stand still like wtf this guy just dodged my skill by standing still( game menu auto attack off). and the proceeded to swing my arms up and down ctrl  emote. I did similar things after with Gnar and also realized that Gnar is actually Riots best designed champion along side kled.   


Funny, goofy, with weird wild and fun emotes. Combine this with a game mode that's not ranked = Why I fell in love with the game in the first place. It brought me back down to my roots of playing random champions doing funny emotes at my enemy while they emote back before dueling. Funny animation in a multiple maps like twisted treeline and dominion. Even in normals I remembered doing funny things like picking Evelyn and in a 5v5 mid fight i would go behind the entire enemy team and come out of stealth just standing there and once they start coming at me. i would w( old sprint) and run away. They would go back to push mid again for a 5v5 and i would repeat the same thing. until they commit to chasing me the entire game &gt; winning.

By emotes i mean ctrl 1234 and not the stickers.

leagueoflegends,Balance Buffs on ARAM make some champions feel worthless,"These buffs on the picture belong to Seraphine but this post is not specifically about her. The sheer amount nerfs applied to the character either by being high in numbers or the fact that for example she's targeted with 5 different levers make champions feel worthless to even attempt to play. Regardless of the power level before or after the balance is applied seeing that much nerfing feels degrading as a player. Lately Rioters started talking about balance as not only win rate but the fun and opportunity the players of the champion and the opponents have during matchups. This here feels pretty unfun. ARAM already doesn't have homeguard animations so why would I, a casual ARAM player, continue to buy skins or worse grind for a mythic to see my champion hit with nerfs after nerfs and feeling useless as a player on a champion I got stuck on after two rerolls. This has made my recent ARAM games a lot less fun. As I said before it is not specific to Seraphine. I like playing ADC Ashe and it has some big damage nerfs and feels useless, the vision changes and 50% AOE to minions on the already 75% AOE to minions nerf on Teemo and Riot buffing assassins and fighters so an Akali can one shot with a single q while flying by me or a Jax that is unkillable even with all the right champions and itemization. Sorry this has been all over the place but ARAM doesn't feel like the fun place I used to play at anymore

leagueoflegends,Learn to swap lanes when needed. You don't HAVE to go to a certain lane to play the game. Especially when you're up against your counter.,"Heres the thing that grinds everyone's gears:

Example:

* When the midlane opponent is literally their hard counter (like Kassadin against their mage pick or Yasuo against their projectile ranged pick)
* And their own top laner is the perfect counter to that (like a Garen or Renekton who destroy Kass or Yasuo)
* And then the top says they should swap so they have a better time laning.
* They go ""No I only mid! IDC.""
* And then they get their asses handed to them in mid lane
* Then they whine about how the jungler should have helped them more.

Yeah, no. You don't get to whine like a man-child.

* Your team gave you an out from the hard counter lane.
* you stubbornly refused to swap
* You got stretched out by your lane opponent as a result.
* Thats on you. You made the bed, you lie in it, don't blame someone else.

Learn to swap, or continue to lose in champ select.",jtpredator,19/03/23 01:44:33 PM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11vcr36/learn_to_swap_lanes_when_needed_you_dont_have_to/

By riot's own admission, the relative strength of duskblade is weak because master yi uses it too well in lower elos. Surely this is a really roundabout way of somehow not nerfing yi and instead shoehorning every assassin into prowlers or eclipse instead? The only assassin who can use it particularly well is rengar because his damage is already insane and he has crit ratios so he can go duskblade for strictly the utility. Also I have no idea who is running around with duskblade darius even in low elo.

I can understand prowlers 'removing counterplay', I.e  qiyana E on minion into prowlers R for example, but I have 0 clue why they are basically keeping duskblade as not an option for assassins outside of like rengar only for no other reason than 'master yi uses it well in  low elo and we refuse to nerf the item on him, so we are just going to keep it weak for the entire subclass of assassins, yup definitely not a yi problem'. Even then, assassins are meant to have mobility and stealth so having an item that allows for that is inherently not problematic (as opposed to giving darius a dash with old stridebreaker, an immobile class, or currently items like zhonyas and shieldbow, overheal, bloodthirster making otherwise squishy classes extremely tanky if itemised for it).

And if its a problem when strong and somehow you can't find a way to tune it down on Yi, you can just add lethality/mpen/crit ratios to assassins to allow them to itemise lethality as a more effective option than a bruiser build. Or just rework Yi because his gameplay is outdated and being 'untargetable' while he is DPSing is not fun even if he is an objectively weak champion right now.",ProfHarambe,13/03/23 11:34:59 PM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11qcwxn/why_are_riot_balancing_items_for_classes_outside/

leagueoflegends,"Gangplank is in a really problematic spot in balance, so hear me out","Gangplank enjoyers and haters alike, I would appreciate your opinions and visibility to this post, because it's about time Riot fixed him both for people playing against him and people playing with him. (And no, the solution should never be ""gutting him to the ground"".)

Simply, he needs an adjustment, urgently. Not necessarily a mid-scope rework, but maybe Riot could look into the possibility of it too, maybe?

Without further ado, let's look at his issues first, both versus him and as him, and then my thoughts on the solutions.

Versus him:

1. He deals too much damage. I have tested his damage several times over the last couple of years. At the moment, at full build + pot, he deals 2100 TRUE DAMAGE (Yes, true damage) with each barrel to anyone with less than 140 armor.
2. He can play around the crit gamble game and fish for lucky crits, if he gets lucky, he just kills you even if he doesn't deserve it. (Also, if he gets unlucky, he can lose fights he deserved to win, too.)
3. His passive true damage is just way over the top (yes, even now after the most recent nerf).
4. His Q poking can be very, very, very annoying (and let's put Malphite into the same category, for the record).
5. His R could potentially win or lose a botlane fight which could decide the outcome of their roles and, subsequently, the game.

As him:

1. Even though he deals insanity levels of damage, his overall cooldowns are too long, which means that any time he has his abilities up, he is too strong for anyone, but any time he has his abilities down, he's probably the most useless champion in the entire 150+ character game.
2. After his recent nerfs displaying his barrel charges, he is extremely vulnerable during the laning phase, which means that any champion with a remotely higher kill pressure than him during that phase will just play around his charges and run him down whenever he has 0 or 1 point under his HP bar.
3. He is a stomp or int champion who either completely obliterates his enemy without any chance of comeback, or he dies once and never recovers and loses the game with report-worthy stats.
4. And lastly, let's say it, it honestly s\*\*ks that he's been in such an op spot that he's become a hated champion. Back then he was fun and people respected GP players, now he's just one more of those OP bunch of toplaners who just stat check others if he's remotely ahead.

What can we do?

1. Addressing the damage. Just lower it. Lower it, Riot. Chunk it, specially the barrel one. Don't worry, Gangplank players will not mind his damage being lower as long as there is some kind of mechanical compensation; and everyone else in the community will love not getting surprise one-shot by him when he gets lucky crits. I mean, it's enough to get one-shot by Rengar's Q all the time, so let squishies catch a break.
2. Addressing his cooldowns. Lower them. Just lower them a ton. The combo of chunking down his damage across the board and in return giving him short cooldowns could have this outcome: less frustrating for others since he's not gonna be a one-shot machine, while also being fun for the one playing him since he's not gonna be so useless after using his charges and having to wait a minute without being able to do anything + he would be a lot less vulnerable in lane thanks to his barrels being present more often; less oppressive, since less damage, but also not so weak that he can just get ran down by anyone just because.
3. Addressing his poke and laning phase Q bullying. How about we go with this: his Q will cost even more mana than it does right now, so poking champions will be just an unviable strat since he'd run out of mana after 3 Q's. In return, he will get rewarded by using his Q on MINIONS instead, by giving him a huge cooldown and mana refund on minion kill. Also, maybe you could reduce his silver serpent gain by -1 per ability point, just because, idk. Now, I know the problem comes about the Essence Reaver rush just enabling him to just fish for crits. To this I might add this idea: how about the Q on its own dealing maybe 90% of its actual damage to champions, but full damage if its used on a barrel? The percentage can be fine-tuned along the way.
4. Addressing his passive damage. Remember that buff Riot gave GP where his crit chance gave him extra damage on his true damage burn? Hear me out, how about, instead of extra damage, his crit chance gave him extra move speed?
5. Addressing his frustration points for people playing AS him. The issue is: you stomp, you win on your own / meta toplaner kills you once, you inted the game and 5 people lose because of it. My solution is simple: implement my previous points, and to that add a bit of defensive stats. Not over the top, maybe just a base move speed buff and small digit increases to his starting armor, magic resist and hp (without touching scaling). Given that he's not gonna be the frustrating crit fishing one-shot machine anymore, he can safely get more stats without breaking the game.

Now come some points that are my personal thoughts, and overall misc ideas that could be worthy to be thought about.

1. Addressing his global R. This is a controversial one, but how about making it not global, but more oriented on dueling, skirmishing, and teamfights where he IS in? You could increase its damage overall and shorten its cooldown, but make it so that GP has to be close to where he is gonna ult, so he stops being just a botlane assist bot during laning phase and has to be present in fights preemptively if he wants to ult, adding to his macro skill floor. Again, this is a controversial point, but I think it is worth looking into.
2. Addressing the crit chance issue. Let's be honest, nobody likes his current gambling style, not even the players themselves. Maybe Riot could reevaluate the possibility of giving him linear scaling on his barrels, so instead of fishing for luck, he has a fair, predictable, linear scaling. It could work just like his passive does right now, having a base AD scaling and an increase based on his crit chance.So, this would mean: no more 20% lucky crits winning his lane or the game / no more 80% unlucky crit-less barrels leaving him dead or losing an entire teamfight. The numbers should be adjusted properly, however.And lastly, this also means that he can open up to new item possibilities, making him more versatile and viable with different builds, instead of being forced to always brainlessly buying the same 6 items every single game which make him so over the top, currently.

As a last section, I would like to address certain in-game issues with the champion itself.

1. His hitbox is too big for his model. Either make his model match his hitbox or his hitbox match his model. This is frustrating since it leads to issues with skillshots, walking, and even hitting minions correctly.
2. There is a ""lag"" sort of thing with his barrels in which enemies can defuse them when they still have 2 points of HP if they hit them right before they tick down to 1. They shouldn't get disarmed if they're not at the 1 HP tick yet, period.
3. There is a glitch to his auto attacks that has been in the game ever since his rework, and I'm not sure why it hasn't been seen as priority since it really breaks the game for the player sometimes. The issue being, sometimes the character will randomly stop his autoattack mid-swing and then repeat it immediately. I call it ""auto-attack repeat bug"". I'm not sure why it happens, but it happens a lot, and many times it screws with the barrel timings and even cs'ing itself.

And as a last note. Let's look at the items, please. We all know here that the biggest issue right now with the game has to do with the items, not the champions themselves.",LeSocairOG,15/03/23 08:58:33 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11rgzam/gangplank_is_in_a_really_problematic_spot_in/

Ultra hope incoming: 

**(P) Perseverance:**

(UNCHANGED)

**(Q) Decisive Strike: Cooldown: 8 seconds.**

(UNCHANGED):

Garen breaks free from all slows affecting him, and gains 35% movement speed for 1/1.65/2.3/2.95/3.6 seconds.

(UNCHANGED):

His next basic attack within 4.5 seconds deals (per rank)30/60/90/120/150 (+50% Attack Damage) physical damage, silences his target for 1.5 seconds.

**(NEW)** INNATE: *Retribution*: Silencing a Champion with this ability marks them as the Villain (Sus) for the duration of the silence (1.5 seconds).

Garen's next basic attack against the Villain consumes the mark dealing 3% (+2.5% Bonus Health) target maximum health Magic damage, empowering his basic attacks against champions to deal bonus Magic damage equal to 4% of Garen's maximum health, and granting 4% move speed towards the villain until his next basic ability is cast.

**(W) Courage:** **Cooldown: 23/21/19/17/15 seconds.**

(CHANGED):

**(NEW)** Passive: Killing units permanently grants 0.2 armor and magic resist, up to a maximum of 50 (up from 30).

(From Riste's Changes List): Large minions and monsters grant .4 armor and magic resist.

(CHANGED):

Active: Garen steels his courage for 2/2.75/3.5/4.25/5 seconds, reducing all incoming damage by 60%. **(NEW)** For the first 0.75 seconds, he also gains a shield for 65/85/105/125/145 +20% (up from from 18%) of his maximum health and 60% Tenacity.

**(NEW):** Passive: *Determination*: If Garen mitigates incoming damage with his shield, damaging an enemy champion with a basic ability within 6 seconds of shielding himself allows this ability to be recast.

Recast: Garen gains a smaller shield for 10% of his maximum health for 0.75 seconds and heals for 8% (+20% bonus Armor/bonus Magic Resist) of Garen's missing health, reducing the remaining cooldown of this ability by 20%.

**(E) Judgement:** **Cooldown: 9 seconds.**

(CHANGED):

Garen rapidly spins his sword around his body for 3 seconds, dealing 4/8/12/16/20 (+0 - 8.2 (based on level) **(NEW)**(+30% (decreased from 32 - 40%) total attack damage) physical damage 7 (+1 per 25% attack speed from items and levels) times, **(NEW)** plus 20% of his maximum health as physical damage over the the duration of this ability, increased to **(NEW)** 25% of his maximum health to the nearest enemy PRIORITIZING champions.

(From Riste's Changes List) As Garen's champion size increases, Judgement's radius increases linearly with his size.

Enemy champions hit by 6 spins lose 25% of their armor for 6 seconds **(NEW)** and are marked as the Villain (Sus).

(UNCHANGED): Recast: Garen ends Judgment prematurely, reducing its cooldown by its remaining duration.

(UNCHANGED): Deals 4/8/12/16/20% damage to non-Epic monsters.

**(R) Demacian Justice:** **Cooldown: 120/100/80** **seconds.**

(CHANGED):

Garen calls upon the might of Demacia to attempt to execute an enemy champion, dealing true damage equal to **(NEW)** 150/200/300 plus 35% of the target's missing health **(NEW)** and sending out a shockwave, (300 range) knocking up enemies within the shock radius for 0.75 seconds.  
(Base damage values decreased at all ranks after the first, from 150/350/450 and % missing health damage changed to a flat 35% from 25/30/35%.)

**Base Stats:**

* Base Armor: 36 (+4.2 per level) &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 32 (+5.2 per level)
* Magic Resist: 32 (+1.55 per level) &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 32 (+2 per level)
* Health: 690 (+98 per level) &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 650 (+111 per level)
* Attack Speed: 0.63 (+3.65% per level) &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; .60 (+7% per level)

Explanations:

All juggernauts currently in the game are: Darius, Dr. Mundo, Garen, Illaoi, Mordekaiser, Nasus, Sett, Shyvana, Trundle, Udyr, Urgot, Volibear, and Yorick.

In one form or another juggernauts will intrinsically have tools for extended trades due to the fact that they are built to not only deal high amounts of damage, but most importantly, take/mitigate high amounts of damage.

The addition of the Villain mechanic on Q and E is intended to set up Garen to participate in extended trades as his class is typically enabled to do because when he is waiting for cooldowns he can now dish out meaningful damage through enhanced auto attacks. Since the bonus damage from Villain scales with target maximum health and Garen's bonus health, as a juggernaut should, he will be able to deal with tanks, fighters and other Juggernauts on a level where he has a fighting chance but can still be punished if too many mistakes are made. Timing when to consume the Villain mark and how many basic attacks to weave in before an ability shuts it off again is intended to encourage skill expression via an added layer of Passive/Active management.

W stacks increasing from 30 to 50 is intended to ensure Garen remains tanky, relative to the rest of the champion roster Post-Durability update with the W conditional/re-engagement healing giving Garen higher outplay potential, and changing the dynamic of previously unplayable or non- interactive matchups, to be more proactive rather than reactive. Garen heals back more health the more he is missing to compliment the original skill expression of the ability, to establish the idea that any healing gained from timing each W interaction (because 2 conditions must be met) will be well earned, and to feed into his identity as a juggernaut : **melee titans who relentlessly march down the opposition and devastate those foolish enough to get within their grasp**.

E damage dealing a percentage of Garen's maximum health over the entire duration is intended to add skill expression through increased resource management and situational awareness, as well as to ensure Garen benefits from building defensive items like the rest of his class, as opposed to drastically sacrificing damage for slightly more survivability. Dealing a percentage of his health over the entire duration instead of each individual spin further separates his full crit builds from his Juggernaut builds because the player must commit to the full spin to gain the most damage output, thus earning a true necessity for health/defensive stats.

R base damage being lowered after the first rank with percent missing health damage being adjusted to a large flat percentage amount is intended to discourage ultimate ""rewards"" gained through shorter trade encounters as if they were longer trade encounters and to more encourage the use of R against beefier targets instead. The knock up is intended to add a thematic touch.

Base armor goes down with armor growth going up to account for an increase in armor gained from W passive stacking and what would be an expected increase in armor item purchase diversity. Magic Resist growth goes up to a flat amount for a tiny, tiny bit of help against mages. Base Health goes down with an increase in health growth to solidify the distinction between choosing a squishier build with squishier items over a tankier build with tankier items. Attack speed growth is buffed to relieve Garen of suffering from item volatility.

And uh...

leagueoflegends,Questions about essence reaver and it’s value in terms of overall damage and utility,"How valuable is this weapon in terms of pure dps? I’m wondering because it clearly has major benefits for mana recovery, but I know the haste and on hit damage is typically sought after by the champs that pick it up. How valuable is spellblade itself compared to raw stats from say going for a mythic first item or a collector 2nd item for example? Also wondering why ezreal often takes both essence reaver and manamune since I’m imagining that either would individually be sufficient for mana sustain. Is it because he desperately needs that early mana recovery asap? Or that it is genuinely a very good dps item when considering his kit? I’ve always kind of ignored the item tbh but now I’m genuinely wondering on who and when I should take it on. Appreciate any useful insight",gayweedlord,17/03/23 12:53:04 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11szjrh/questions_about_essence_reaver_and_its_value_in/

leagueoflegends,Matchmaking Explanation,"I understand this thread has been done half to death but Im still genuinely confused. How do I improve my matchmaking? How am I supposed to understand this picture? This isnt a new thing either, though I did just come off a loss streak that brought my overall winrate down from 59% to 55%. All season Ive been getting matched against people below me in ranked, with sub 50% or barely 50% winrates. And once I hit silver my average MMR has remained bronze in most games but my LP gains dropped and losses rose from when I was getting through bronze. If winrate doesnt decide game level and LP changes, what does?

Despite the occasional inters/trolls, I always focus on my own performance because as long as I capitalize on recognizing &amp; fixing my mistakes rather than flaming all game, I think I’ll eventually get to where I’ve improved to the point where I carry almost every game until I reach higher elo (gold 4 atm which is super poopy I know). But when I get that 6/21 bot lane and lose an absurd amount of LP despite not even getting a chance to play the game I feel like I’m wasting my time trying to get better and climb.

leagueoflegends,"When this post is 21 hours old, the first Berlin Derby Bo5 between Eintracht Spandau and BIG in the Prime League starts","Tomorrow Eintracht Spandau and BIG will meet for the first time in a best of 5 at 6pm CET.

Eintracht Spandau vs BIG is the biggest rivalry in the Prime League/Germany and perhaps even one of the biggest in the ERLs.

Ever since Spandau joined the league in Spring 2022 they picked on BIG as a rival because they both represent opposites in a way, whereas BIG is a modern esports org with an international audience, Spandau takes on the image of an old-fashioned football club and exclusively targets a German audience. Another reason is of course the regional proximity. Spandau is a district of Berlin but they see themselves as an independent city.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/m1s0mwmiq5oa1.png?width=921&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=86f03486e268790fbccb60766e776f54bc542a52

What to expect:

Despite Spandau having played a much better regular season overall, they have lost 4 out of their last 6 games whereas BIG has only lost 1 out of their last 6. So they will likely be evenly matched, with slight benefits to Spandau (probably 60/40) because they did win both regular season games against BIG.

In terms of style, both teams are strong in the early game. Spandau has the highest GD@15 in the league with 1839. They often gain large advantages in lane, especially bot lane. Their ADC SMILEY has an insane 968 GD@15 and 22 CSD@15 which both are the highest in the league. However Spandau is known to frequently throw their leads away, especially in their recent games. BIG on the other hand knows how to finish quickly once they have a lead, with 31:17 min they have the 2nd shortest game duration in the league.",SpandauerBuben,17/03/23 03:59:55 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11t4jj8/when_this_post_is_21_hours_old_the_first_berlin/

leagueoflegends,Why is it so outdated?,"So I used to love playing LoL. I used to play it every single day, but eventually stopped playing it for around 4 years. I came back to it a couple of weeks ago and it was a bit disappointing to see how many champions were still looking super outdated, I would have thought that by now most of the older champions would have at least gotten a visual review. I was specially excited when I saw the mobile game I thought that meant that the champions on PC would had been updated as well but no, I still enjoy the game but everything looks a bit the same as it always had… Why aren’t there different versions of the normal 5v5 map by now? Or better champion models, perhaps little cutscenes or animations about lore per character like other Mobas do. 

I don’t know, I think considering the massive success of the game I was expecting that to show a bit more… I think they need to make a big update of the game in general. It looks a bit weird specially comparing newer champions with old ones",lyingchalice,12/03/23 10:52:37 PM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11pgci6/why_is_it_so_outdated/

leagueoflegends,FEATURE REQUEST: Win/Lose LP based on game rating,"Playing mindfully and trying to be better should be an essential part of the game and highest priority for Riot Games!

There is no worse feeling than being an awesome player in a losing game. The Ranked system should have a feature where the highest your game rating, the more the LP on lose or less LP on loss.

I've attached some screenshots of a recent game of mine where I'm clearly the best player with the best score from both teams and lost a full amount of LP where did not deserve to.

I believe this system can really improve the good players' experience as well as reduce their frustration if their team loses the game.

Q - can stack up to 2.

W adds a stack to to bomb if at 0, and stays the same.

leagueoflegends,Skin ideas for every champ - Q,"Hello everyone!

Shortest post so far, let's get into Q.

**Qiyana**

*Debonair*: I feel it matches her personality. Elegant aristocrat but in a ""This dress costs more than your life"" kinda way.

*Victorious*: Again, matches her personality. I'm the victor, the best, the champion, people should see that when they look at me.

*Blood Moon*: Usually works with assassins, don't see any reason why it wouldn't fit her.

*Ocean Song*: Giant sun hat, pool ring.

*Mythmaker*: I imagine something very similar to Sivir. Both the normal and the prestige version.

**Quinn**

*Battle Eagle*: Anima Squad skin, I think it works well and the animal theme is there.

*Quinn Bee*: I didn't alone come up with this, but the name is just too good to miss out on.

*Dragon Trainer*: Makes sense, right?

*Omen of the Dark*: Once again those 3 skins of Noc, Kayle and Singed. One of the best skin groups in the game and Riot didn't continue it fsr. Here I imagine Valor as a raven. Quinn is somewhere between Singed and Kayle with a crossbow.

*High Noon*: Valor is a vulture - same as Anivia - , for Quinn, just make the crossbow more gun-ish and it's ready to go.

*Prehistoric/Beast Hunter*: Again, same as with Anivia, Valor is a pterodactyl.

*Sentinel*: Imo she fits into this group very nicely.

*Omega Squad*: Aerial agent. If that makes sense. xd

*Faerie Court*: Valor is a butterfly! Or at least has butterfly wings if we'd want to keep her as a bird (?)

leagueoflegends,Breaking Down 100 Thieves Game Losing Mistake (vs EG),"100 Thieves have been looking better since the coaching change but this easily avoidable miscommunication mistake is game losing vs better teams.

[https://clips.twitch.tv/EmpathicProudVampireNotLikeThis-UvekAwC7DDjJvJGw](https://clips.twitch.tv/EmpathicProudVampireNotLikeThis-UvekAwC7DDjJvJGw)

Bjerg clears the wave and goes for a reset while Jojo catches the wave. Bjerg knows that Jojo just got back to lane 40 seconds ago so there is very little chance he is recalling again. That must mean he is looking for a roam or getting vision for his team.

DL and Busio and even Closer should be telling the entire team that there is a massive wave crashing bot, even the casters call it out. This isn't communicated to the team so Bjerg autopilots TP to mid while his bot lane just gets blasted and lose tower shortly after. There is no pressure on Bjerg to use TP mid here as Veigar isn't in lane pushing the wave. Holding it for just a second to see what's developing would be the veteran move so there must have been some lack of info from the botlane and jungler about the bot wave.

They still pulled out a nice win but I'm wondering how veteran players are making simple macro mistakes like this. What's even crazier is Closer is topside, nowhere near to cover the no summoner spell botlane. Against a more disciplined team, there is no hope for the rest of the game.

How can the team improve on these sorts of mistakes? Is it on Bjerg to recognize the play and to be more aware of the wave states? Should DL/Busio and Closer have better communication and cover the wave crashing? Really intriguing to see these mistakes being made on a team with lots of experienced players.",sjb_fan,18/03/23 12:06:02 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11tvd03/breaking_down_100_thieves_game_losing_mistake_vs/

leagueoflegends,Queue dodging is too punishing &amp; pick order swap can be very toxic towards support players,"First of all, i'm a big fan of order swapping in champion select and i love the system, however i've seen people (mostly toplaners) tilt because support or adc doesn't wanna swap for first pick and i've seen 3-4 occasions where i had to dodge because they tilted when our support didn't swap.  


Which brings us to the next part.  


I had to dodge 2 games today because of this exact same reason. Support didn't swap, top/jungle started flaming, picked lulu/soraka jungle and stated that they're gonna int the game. I always wait till the last moment until i dodge, however noone did so i had to do it. Saddest part is that it was around 30 mins until timer reset.  


Imo there should be a solution to this for soloqueue. Maybe if 3 or 4 people report the troll then dodging would be less punishing for the rest and the troll could get punished immediately by having a few hours of dodge timer.",Papafru,17/03/23 12:35:13 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11sz27w/queue_dodging_is_too_punishing_pick_order_swap/

leagueoflegends,"I refuse to believe Riot actually ended ""smurf queue""","I have a silver 4 rank. Ok. I was high diamond for years in past seasons on old accounts, and I didn't magically degrade into a silver player. Right now I'm getting +25 LP for a win and -21 LP for a loss. This would be fine if I was playing in legit silver ranked games but there's no way in hell my games are silver. My games usually have at least a few people playing at a diamond skill level, the majority are playing at platinum skill, and then you always have a few stragglers below that getting absolutely destroyed. so basically plat skill level games. the kicker is all these players are smurfs with low ranks, either because they're on a new account, they're using someone elses account, or whatever. that's the reality of these games. dividing up the queue is unhealthy for the game, and LP gains and losses don't make sense. riot simply doesn't want smurfs in low ranked games, fine, then give them legit LP gains and losses. no but I get it, they want to punish smurf players, zoning them out of real high elo to make high elo rank harder to get, while at the same time keeping them from real low ranked games. it's an evil genius way of sticking it to smurfs I guess. shitty.",byeboomerdinos,14/03/23 09:42:05 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11qsydt/i_refuse_to_believe_riot_actually_ended_smurf/

leagueoflegends,How to fix the autofill issue forever.,"Make it so picking either Autofill or the least popular role at any given time will grant you an Hextech Chest and Key every 3 wins.

So if you decide to queue fill or support, you get random skin shards. Only on wins though so people have an actual incentive to actually try and don't just afk on you with Janna.

The queue times would go down to the point where I am certain you wouldn't even need auto fill anymore.

And of course, it would only work for Solo/Duo, to prevent people from just exploiting the system by having 3+ premades all queueing fill to farm chests in Normals.",Final_Foot_Fucker,14/03/23 01:53:49 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11qgh37/how_to_fix_the_autofill_issue_forever/

leagueoflegends,My thoughts on the Fnatic situation,"I will start by saying that this is my subjective thoughts and i don't claim to know anything for a fact, rather this is based on what I've heard and seen. And i will admit that i haven't researched this extensively, so take it with a grain of salt. 

I'll start by making some points regarding people connected to Fnatic. 

Yamato: From what I've heard and seen Yamato talk about, it seems like he was either pushed out or he left due to disagreement in vision with the management. He mentions that during worlds he was pressured to sub Hyli out for Rhucks and he didn't agree with this, and basically said if you want to do this you have to fire me on the spot, in his own words. 
He basically points out the base of Fnatic's problem, by saying that if you look at the pattern it's obvious what the mistake are. 
I think that what he is trying to say here is that Fnatic doesn't value the players that have worked hard in building this org. He also mentions in the same conversation that they have created a situation twice where the players don't want to play. And if i understood him correctly this is the base problem. When you have players like Upset and Wunder who really are assets at this point the management should seek to resolve the situation to have their assets on the team rather than replacing them. It seems Yamato had created a really nice team environment that focused on resolving the issues in the team, and when that vision wasn't the same for Fnatic he wasn't a part of them any longer. 

Hyli: Again from what Yamato mentions it's clear that management wanted to push Hyli out already during worlds. Another asset who has played a big role in building this org.  I'm not quite sure if they thought his performance wasn't up to par or his style was too different. But again this leads back to what i mentioned before that instead of replacing him they should maybe have found a way to incorporate his style into their play. 

Upset: Upset said that he didn't feel like they were taking scrims seriously and he didn't agree with that. Who he specifically talked about is hard to know. And this could perhaps be backed up by Rekkles saying that they started scrims much later than the other teams. 

Rhucks: It seems like the management intended for  Rhucks to replace Hyli since worlds and he did. Caedrel mentions that Rhucks had a hard time playing ranged supports, and that forced Rekkles to change his champion pool in a weird way. The synergy wasn't there and Rekkles himself said that he felt like Varus and Xayah where almost the only picks that worked for them, in the current meta. After winter they realized that their original intention wasn't going to happen so they replaced Rhucks. Once again replacing a player. This also seemed like the only option if they were intent on replacing him and Upset didn't want to play. 

Wunder: Wunders situation is a tricky one and i don't think this is as straightforward as some people likes to paint it. From the outside it looks like a problem with who should play weakside and this basically means that either Wunder or Rekkles is forced to change their play style or one of them had to be replaced. But i don't think it's that ""simple"". 
First and foremost when you listen to people in the scene talk about the situation it doesn't sound like he was just sacked nor did he just refuse to play. I think there might have been a conflict between Wunder and Dardo, and a disagreement in vision but also understanding. When Dardo talked about Oscarinin joining he made sure to emphasize multiple times that he was ""hungry"". Even Caedrel mentioned that maybe Fnatic felt like Wunder was lacking motivation, but at the end of the day he was playing well, given the circumstances. And i think this is where the Wunder situation started. Dardo felt like Wunder wasn't ""hungry"" enough and perhaps Wunder felt like the problem was something else and in the end they couldn't see eye to eye. I think Wunder laid out some conditions if he was to continue and Fnatic either couldn't meet them or they wouldn't. The latter seems more likely for me by replacing him. I'm also confident that he was offered to play academy. And this again goes back to what Yamato was saying about creating situations where players don't want to play. When you hear Perkz talking about Wunder or Dardo it really feels like this was initiated by a stupid conflict between them. 

Rekkles: Not long ago Grabbz said that Rekkles wasn't quite his favorite player to coach and that he was a stubborn person in a passive aggressive way. He mentions that Rekkles wouldn't adapt to the G2 ""culture"" at the time and that made him a bad fit and frustrating to work with. The same could be true now, but i can't say for sure. From a business standpoint Fnatic just used alot of resources in bringing him back, branding this comeback and creating this hype around him. So in a imaginary situation where they had to chose either to go with Wunder or Rekkles, its clear what Fnatic thought made the most sense. As mentioned before Fnatic wanted to play Rhucks even before bringing back Rekkles and both of them came to play simultaneously. When they identified that there was a problem both in botlane synergy and between bot and top they had to look at their options, especially since it's extremely hard to make big changes between winter and spring (a type of mid season). Replacing Rekkles was completely out of question. So either they had to buy a new support, or play Rekkles as support and Upset as ADC (i don't think Upset wanted to play either way), or bringing Advienne in. 

Humanoid/Razork: To be honest i dont know much about their situations since i haven't heard alot about them. Many fans believe that Razork and Humanoid doesn't have that mid/jungle synergy, but we have seen it work before. In my opinion i think they are stuck in the middle of this situation to a point where they have lost all confidence and will. Watching some of Fnatic's games there is moments where it feels like they are afraid to make certain plays because of lack of confidence and Yamato mentions that you have to make sure that these type of players  feels comfortable and confident because this is where they perform at their best.

I will once again mention that this is MY opinion and i don't state any of this as factual. If you made it to the end thank you for reading and please leave your thoughts about this in the comments.",Laksaakom,14/03/23 01:17:46 PM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11qxgts/my_thoughts_on_the_fnatic_situation/

leagueoflegends,Doublelift's Influence on Bot Lane Taking Ghost,"Hello,

&amp;#x200B;

Back in August 2022, Doublelift released a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni1Lijx2vI0) regarding why hyper carry adc's should take ghost instead of other non-flash summoner spells. As Doublelift is one of the most popular NA LoL players, I wanted to see his real impact on the game/community. 

&amp;#x200B;

Shown below is the percentage of bot players per day who took ghost in ranked games. As you can see, **before the video uploaded bot players were taking ghost about 1-2% of the time each game, but after the video this metric was about 4-10% of each game**. This doesn't seem like a huge jump, but it does appear that **Doublelift's video influenced the League of Legends bot lane community** even last month when the percentage was about 5-10%.

&amp;#x200B;

**Data Details:** 

Region: North America

Total Number of Ranked Games Evaluated:  58,641

Date Range:   May 11, 2022 - February 13, 2023 (3 months before and 6 months after video)

Minimum Number of Games per Day: \~90

Video Upload Date: August 10, 2022

For more details please visit my [GitHub](https://github.com/GitErickL) where I go over this project in far more detail.

&amp;#x200B;

**Request:** 

I make these claims, but there is the obvious question of ""Is Doublelift's video the only catalyst for this trend?"" I searched through Reddit, YouTube and Twitter and couldn't find any media/posts about ADC's taking ghost around the time that this video was uploaded. I want to do my due diligence with this project as I am very interested in the true influence of Doublelift on the community. So if you have any knowledge of other media figures/influencers in the League of Legends community that could have also promoted ghost around the same time that Doublelift did, that information would be very much appreciated.

leagueoflegends,A scenario exists where MAD Lions can get 9th place in LEC Spring Split and still be the #2 LEC representative for MSI 2023.,"First of all this is obviously extremely unlikely, but it's possible.

There are different permutations that allow it by placing different teams in the middle differently. 

Here's an example of such a scenario: **[Image of Scenario](https://i.imgur.com/6AmMB8k.png)**


Again, it's extremely unlikely but possible. Thanks to /u/mrpraedor for mentioning this in a comment. They made me aware of the possibility.

**The more likely scenario is this:**

- MAD/KOI goes to MSI on points if G2 wins again.


In any case, if G2 wins Spring again it's pretty likely that the loser of Spring finals doesn't go to MSI (unless it's MAD or KOI).

Vitality basically has to win in many scenarios to attend MSI.

-------------------------------


In my opinion, the most doomed scenario for EU fans is:

- Vitality loses a close 5 game series to G2 in the final.

- MAD makes it to BO5 stage but fails to win any BO5s.

- KOI doesn't make a deep run.

---&gt; **MAD qualifies on championship points again without winning a single BO5 in Spring.**

I should add that this post is not flaming MAD. I hope they do well and repeat their success from last split. They are clearly a good team. I hope if MAD goes we all agree that they deserve the spot as the most competitive team. And honestly I think that's pretty likely. They played super well in Winter.",Jozoz,13/03/23 07:01:26 PM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11q6lqb/a_scenario_exists_where_mad_lions_can_get_9th/

leagueoflegends,Make Your Patch,"Heellllloooo fellow challenger reddit game devs.

We all know how divisive every new patch is, with wild off the wall changes.

Ranging from Runes Reforged, to Durability patch, to this preseason and the crit changes, every LoL content creator rages over how broken the game is and the things they hate.

But I crave positivity instead of the toxic negative attitude that permeates every crevice of this games community, so I ask: Make your perfect patch.

Changing jungle systems? Go in detail 
Want AP bruiser itemization? Tell us how, why, and for whom?
Want Yuumi/Yasuo/Yonex removed? Unlikely to happen but go ahead.

I would like to request actual potential changes that could happen, but go do you.
INB4 everyone outs themselves as 1 tricks that only want their champion(s) to be viable.

Note: Yes itd take a while to make a whole patch, but you've all played this long enough to know what you'd want. Personally I'd like huge damage nerfs and the game to slow down in general.",dethmagica91,14/03/23 01:47:28 PM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11qxzoy/make_your_patch/
leagueoflegends,(Genuine Question) Why do League players seem to hate Dota 2?,"Hi guys! My original moba that I started out with was Dota 2. Now I also play League. However, anytime something happens in Dota that I get excited about, I share with some League friends and they immediately respond with, ""Ew Dota."" ""Vomit."", etc. Like today, I just said, ""Check out this cool hero Dota added"". I was showing them Muerta, a new hero, and they immediately just started bashing the game. Of course, this is anecdotal and may not be the case for all league players and vice versa. 

I play both so obviously there are things I like and hate from both games. I know that League surpasses in popularity. But I did play Dota 2 first and it paved a way for a lot of the mobas you see now. It holds a place in my heart and I still like to play.

What is your experience or thoughts? Just looking for a genuine conversation.",xKaedos,18/03/23 01:08:14 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11tx3t1/genuine_question_why_do_league_players_seem_to/
leagueoflegends,"The slow climb issue has not been resolved, I am getting +20/-24lp currently","I like the higher LP gains, it's much better than 15lp per game, but I have a 57% win rate over 88 games in SoloQ and I am getting +20lp for a win and -24 lp for a loss.

leagueoflegends,Is there a statistic about winrates for multiple casters on a team?,"I feel like if your team has 1+ mage than the other; it's like a 60-70% winrate because of how items work nowadays. And even higher if your mid laner chose a melee.

Mages also do more, even when they are behind. (Supports 100-0'ing adc's for example).

Even their ultimates are usually better, like Asol just got Galio's ult on a range click lol!

\*Edit\*

I want to push the envelope further, Nunu Jungle for example compared to other junglers.

leagueoflegends,We need to stop pretending early game champions take skill to exploit.,"Lets be real, Riot has even told us that they WANT games to be fast paced and short, they BALANCE the game entirely around early game advantages and snowballing. Late game champions are crap, and yes this includes alot of the champions alot of really bad players complain about such as nasus vayne, veigar etc. The strongest champions are ALL early game dominant champions and if they're not early game dominant then the influence they peddle at any point of the game is useless.

&amp;#x200B;

We need to fix the community mindset, stop playing the late game champions ( especially the adc late game champions ) they're just bad! I cannot stress it enough that riot has effectively neutered all late game champions by how much they baby the early game champions.   


Late game champions have to be less than a 10th as useful as their early game compatriots in the early game, but early game no skill required champions are EASILY 9 10ths of the late game champ in the late game.

leagueoflegends,How do I increase my damage and def?,I’m a brand new and this is my second day playing mordekaiser and I keep getting out damaged by a lot of people. Jax is able to dive and almost insta kill me when we’re same level with no big items and I just played a game with a dr mundo that had 300+ physical attack. Mundo had heartsteel and sunfire ageis and boots for items. We both got heartsteel and when I was at 85 stacks he was at 165 and we got it at the same time. Idk what I’m doing wrong but I keep dying in toplane and can’t do any damage back since I either die instantly or they straight up out heal me.

leagueoflegends,Did you guys notice the eery similarity of Peanut Q'ing out of the Dragon Pit and Riot's rework of Yuumi?,"Life imitates art

You start off doing everything right. You have a vision set up and sufficient budget to power it through. 

You have a plan then you execute it. You have some hiccups along the way, but it's okay, the most important part is your aim is on point (KDF/gamer gf demographic), then you proceed.

You're blind so you won't see that invulnerability is cancer.

But you accomplished to take out the enemy jungler and gained the people's trust...that you know what you're doing. It is now upon you.

The deadline for the dragon death is coming up, it was coming fast and you're amazed at the pace you're taking it down

But you thought to yourself: maybe we would still die if we had Elder

Or we would lose a playerbase if we gutted Yuumi

Then you try to get a little fancy and multitask by introducing more flavors by jumping Ezreal, kicking him in, and buffing the fck out of Yuumi

Then the enemy takes the Elder

And your rework gets meme'd on Reddit

Everybody beats the crap out of your team

And now you're sad.

But that's okay

Sometimes you miss the point, 

But land the combos",SolubilityRules,13/03/23 02:28:43 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11plsum/did_you_guys_notice_the_eery_similarity_of_peanut/

leagueoflegends,Another issue with the current LEC Championship Points,"For the Season Final (which will crown the LEC champion and will determine which 4 Teams will represent the LEC at Worlds) the best 6 Teams throughout the year will qualify.  
Split winners have a guaranteed seed and the rest of the 6 Teams will be determined by how many Championship Points they gathered.
Below how the current Points distribution looks like:  

Place | Winter | Spring | Summer
---|---|---|---
1 | 120 | 120 | 180
2 | 100 | 100 | 150
3 | 80 | 80 | 120
4 | 60 | 60 | 90
5 | 50 | 50 | 75
6 | 40 | 40 | 60
7 | 30 | 30 | 45
8 | 20 | 20 | 30
9 | 10 | 10 | 15
10 | 5 | 5 | 7 


Now on first glance, this doesn't look too bad. Summer is the most important split, as its right before the Season Final and Worlds, so it's the most relevant one, thus it gives 50% more Points.  
But remember, The League calendar generally has two halves, Spring + MSI and Summer + Worlds. We now have split the old Spring Split into Winter &amp; Spring and they are played back to back at the start of the year, while Summer is about 3 months after Spring with MSI in between. So a lot of time for teams to improve, make roster moves and the meta to change. There won't be too much room for changes between Winter and Spring, this means teams that start well into the year will be able to generate more points than teams that only perform in the Summer split. So Summer split will only contribute about 43% to the total points (For comparison in the LPL it's about 63%). Another thing is how the points are distributed between the ranks. You will not get a significant amount more when you place top 3 compared to the rest. Therefore even if you have a great performance in Summer, it might not be enough to qualify.  

The main issue with all of this is that it will have a huge impact on which teams will qualify for worlds. I don't mind it too much for the Season Final as that tournament is about crowning the best LEC Team of the year, but worlds is not about just one team. You send 4 teams and you want to have the teams that you think are the best at that time, which are usually the teams that performed well in Summer and not the teams that were only good at the start of the year.  
It's not too hard to come up with a realistic scenario where a team finishes 3rd in Summer, but will not have enough points to qualify for the Season Final and thus miss out on Worlds. In general it will feel bad for any teams that seems to have finally clicked and have a good performance in Summer only for their season to end after the 6 weeks of Summer split, because they had a bad start at the beginning of the year.

I think Summer Split does not have the importance that it should have. Any team that performs well there should still have a shot at qualifying for worlds.  
Some Ideas how this could be improved:   
- Increase overall points for Summer and give more Points for top placements compared to average placements  
- Allow 8 Teams in Season Final  
- Have another Worlds qualifying tournament after Season Final, which includes the best Teams from Summer  

TL;DR: Teams that performed bad in the first half of the year might be locked out of qualifying for worlds even if they finish top 3 in Summer",graluox,15/03/23 07:49:50 PM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11ru2b5/another_issue_with_the_current_lec_championship/

leagueoflegends,"Shu, the Tragic Abbot - My Champion Concept!","https://www.artstation.com/artwork/o2rPYq

Hi, folks. Just wanna share my concept for a new Darkin champion that I did for school named Shu, a head monk from Ionia who gave in to the darkness of a scared mask in order to save his monastery and people! 

With a new Darkin rumored to arrive, I thought that I could try my hand into designing one myself with the idea of a tanky fighter in the jungle. I may not have laid out his skills and balancing, I gave him the gimmick of conjuring charcoal-like decaying wood and thought it'll be cool to have a jungler that can alter the trees in the jungle to create or block off paths. Maybe y'all can help me with the process and I hope you can enjoy this little idea of mine, cheers!",Llerrad,16/03/23 11:23:04 PM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11sx537/shu_the_tragic_abbot_my_champion_concept/

leagueoflegends,advice solo carry mid,"Hey there,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently in silver, trying a lot of things to be able to solo carry games and get out of this rank.

&amp;#x200B;

Nothing works so far, I win my lane but don't have enough impact to make it for the usual jungle/bot diff.

&amp;#x200B;

I figured, I don't know for higher elo, but at least in silver, when there is a jungle diff the game is usually won for the side that has the better jungle, so I tried so take an-usual picks such as Lee mid or anything thing that has a good wave clear and mobility to counter jungle, however, nothing really worked so far.

&amp;#x200B;

The usual mid play style ""I win my lane, push, gank"" that I almost got me out of silver last season, at least put my MMR to something higher, doesn't seem to work anymore, even when I help botlane being on top, it just doesn't have as much impact as a hecarim roaming and destroying late game, or a Vi clearing all objectives on top of helping the lane I'm not helping.

&amp;#x200B;

Genuily looking for advice from high ranked mid-laners who managed to climb in soloQ (alone, not with a mate) in this season, and how they manage to have a consistent impact on the game that make them counter-balance the jungle role.

&amp;#x200B;

Just before anyone says it, I hate jungling, so no, I won't switch role, this is not the answer I'm looking for, I'm looking for the general strategy you guys use in this current meta as a midlaner to solo carry, this season, I'm out of ideas.",Raidden37,18/03/23 07:08:36 PM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11ulczh/advice_solo_carry_mid/

leagueoflegends,Skarner should keep his crystal motives in reworked design to distinguish him from Malphite.,"Making Skarner the first Earth elementalist in Ixtal is a really nice approach. However, I think devs didn't think that they already have giant earth protector which is **Malphite** in this region. 

One is Earth Golem, the second is going to be Earth Scorpion. Both have kinda this King Kong vibes and it feels repetitive. 

So yeah, I think one thing to make this two different is keeping the Crystal motives in Skarner design. After all, many scorpions or other arthropods have this metallic, shiny exoskeleton.  Adding crystal elements to Skarner's armor sounds like a good idea. 

What are your thoughts?",LordVaderVader,18/03/23 09:00:34 PM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11unvrd/skarner_should_keep_his_crystal_motives_in/

Why leaving games is so uncommon? I'd be curious to know opinions, especially from toxic players; what is the point of being toxic when leaving the game is the ultimate form of toxicity and you won't get punished for it?

&gt;! I think it should be the jungler. They’re the ones constantly watching the minimap, rotating to every lane and objective, and keeping tabs on the enemy jungler.

Every month or so, I host small game-related events for my friends. I'm thinking of hosting a league of legends version of family feud next, and I'm wondering if you guys would be interested in helping me out by answering some of the survey questions? I appreciate any and all help! :)

Here is a link to the 10 survey questions; it shouldn't take more than a couple of minutes to complete.

Again, thank you very much!

Thanks everyone for the responses; it reached the max capacity and automatically shut down. Here is a link to the results.

The questions highlighted in red will most likely not be used because either the answers swayed too far in one answer's favor, or the answers were a little all over the place ;) Some questions should have been worded more specifically, so that's my bad.

leagueoflegends,"How I climbed to Diamond, and why it might work best for you too","Play a ton of games in a day, get tilted off the face of the earth trying to showcase skill only for it to not matter and lose anyway? I have a perfect method for you I say!

Here is my main acc: [https://www.op.gg/summoners/na/neonlionc](https://www.op.gg/summoners/na/neonlionc). I finally got to Diamond since season 7. 

I learned one specific thing for season 13 league. It is an absolute coinflip on the matchmaking. And there is no point playing a high tempo/skill champion unless you are much better than the opponent. I used to play Qiyana, Zed, Yasuo, Sylas.... but its so tilting when you get camped by jg/sup/top. Why create situations to lose the game, since these champions rely on punishing the enemy to get ahead in a lot of matchups?

Do the NA strat and just scale. I found the best success playing Veigar and Malphite, because the ability to absorb ganks is so infinetly better than other champions. The most consistent champions are the most braindead.   


If you want to play otherwise go ahead its your fun. But if you're serious about climbing and struggling, I suggest just main a scaling. Save your mental, reduce reliance on teammates in early game to help you, and play easy to convert games. Dont play passive for jg/sup tho lol, this is just for top,mid and adc. 

Macro much easier than micro. Always. And you dont need teammates to play well for macro to be effective. 

I play all roles so heres some suggestions:

leagueoflegends,This is how CBLoL stands looks with one week left in the regular stage.,"&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/yjopugrqzdna1.png?width=314&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=d339fcdfe379e6638643c2b164f4223a48bbb485

Well... A few weeks ago I posted here that CBLoL was the most balanced league in the world. But, it turned out that all big organizations will qualify for the playoffs. We won't have any surprises.

Only the last spot is open, and the matches of these teams **(Furia, INTZ and KaBuM!)** are:

* **INTZ** plays against **Fluxo** and **Vivo KeyD**
* **FURIA** plays against **Red Canids** and **Los Grandes**
* **KaBuM!** plays against **Vivo KeyD** and **paiN Gaming**

The point is that Vivo KeyD, despite being in last place, **is a team that can easily beat INTZ and KaBuM! right now. They almost made a miracle run after the roster changes.**

So yeah, nothing is set in stone, but the tendency is for FURIA to qualify with 7 wins.

**Another observation:** There has never been a team in CBLoL that finished the regular stage in first place and became champions in playoffs, and Los Grandes, despite being in first place, is already showing signs of decline, especially from HiRiT and Lava.

So yes, currently the biggest bets are for a repeat between **paiN Gaming** and **LOUD**. Both teams faced a slump during the regular phase, but they are just like old Fnatic, G2 or TSM. No matter the regular stage, they will always make finals.

**Top 3 players in each role right now:**

* **Top: Wizer** (Import - paiN Gaming), **Boal** (Red Canids) and **HiRit** (Import - Los Grandes)
* **Jungle: Aegis** (Red Canids), **Ranger** (Los Grandes) and **Grell** (Import - Vivo Keyd)
* **Mid: Dynquedo** (paiN Gaming), **Tinowns** (LOUD) and **Hauz** (Fluxo)
* **Bot: Netuno** (Los Grandes), **Bvoy** (Import - paiN Gaming), **Titan** (Red Canids) and **Brance** (Fluxo)

*\* ADC is the best role in the CBLoL by far. Netuno, Brance and TitaN would play well in a major region for sure. So yeah, it's a top 4.*

* **Support: Zay** (Los Grandes), **Jojo** (Fluxo) and **Ceos** (LOUD)

**Trivia**

* **Tinowns** and **Dynquedo** are midlaners that have improved a lot and have become top 2 in Brazil thanks to **Xero**, the Korean coach from **paiN Gaming**. He is famous for doing a great job with midlaners. Tinowns played in paiN gaming from 2017 until 2021. Xero is the paiN Gaming head coach since 2019.
* **Lava** and **HiRiT** ***arrived in Brazil as the biggest imports ever***, but individually they are suffering a lot in CBLoL and Los Grandes' botlane (Netuno, 20, and Zay, 17) is saving the team.
* **Red Canids** is **TitaN**'s team, probably the best player mechanically in Brazil today. Besides being very good mechanically, he is a good shotcaller. The team is struggling because they had to use the Academy's support **(scamber)** and the midlane **(Avenger)** is in a very bad moment.
* **Wizer** (paiN Gaming) is ***one split away from gaining residency*** in the CBLoL. He will be the first Korean to achieve this in Brazil if he stays here.
* Toplaners in Brazil, for the most part, ***don't know how to play weak side***. **Wizer**, **HiRit**, **Boal** (top 3) are only playing with carrys. **Robo** (LOUD), **Tay** (Fluxo) and **Guigo** (Vivo KeyD) ***are exceptions.***
* On the other hand, ***midlaners here like to play the map***. ***So roaming midlaners make success around here***. Tinowns, for example, is famous for being dominant with TF and Taliyah.
* The biggest problem in CBLoL are the supports. ***Our support pool is weak***, although good names have been appearing recently: **Zay** (Los Grandes), **Ayu** (FURIA), **scamber** (Red Canids) and **Guigs** (KaBum!)",Dsalgueiro,13/03/23 07:32:05 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11ptjtf/this_is_how_cblol_stands_looks_with_one_week_left/

leagueoflegends,This is the most unfun season by a large margin,"It's not even worth it for junglers to farm anymore. You chain gank or else the enemy jungler does then he's the same (or higher level) than you while snowballing his entire team. Similarly, if you're a top laner and you get camped while your jungle helps bot, the game is insanely unfun. Same if it's vice versa. 

Balance feels like the worst it has ever been, and by an extremely large margin. It feels like all the most braindead ooga booga champions have been buffed into the beyond. Annie, Udyr, Jax, Illaoi, Rumble, Olaf etc etc. The fact that Annie is allowed to have a 55% winrate in challenger is just fucking mindblowing. How is this shit not hotfixed? Everywhere I look there is just mindless statchecking. Lucian Nami every other game. Yuumi is back. 

It feels like counterpicking is more relevant than ever. Many matchups that felt hard now feel almost impossible. When I get counterpicked instead of feeling like the lane will be challenging, I feel like I should dodge so that I don't have to pray my jungler will bail me out. 

The end result is that the game doesn't feel good at all unless you get counterpick and / or your jungle decides that you're the one he wants to babysit. 

I honestly miss the days when jungling was relatively balanced between farming and ganking and when junglers were incentivized to counterjungle. I miss when top lane was mostly stuff like Irelia / Fiora / Camille / Riven / Aatrox and the lanes could go either way depending on who was the best player, not who got the last pick.",deeznutz133769,14/03/23 04:19:00 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11qkfau/this_is_the_most_unfun_season_by_a_large_margin/
leagueoflegends,"If Riot cares so much about curbing toxicity, why did they add 'Role diff' titles?","Mid diff, supp diff etc. Doesn't this just incentivize players to act more toxic when winning or losing?

leagueoflegends,Random Idea I had for Skarner,"I don't know why, but I just had the most random idea for a rework.

Passive - Skarner's spells give a mark of Crystal. Auto attacks pop the mark and refund X% of his basic ability's cooldowns + heals Skarner for X% of his missing HP. 

Q - I was thinking of an AoE version of Sett Q. Where Skarner cleaves the area in front of him twice. Auto reset. 

W - Any enemy within 700 range who has a mark of Crystal on them, Skarner lunges his stinger at. Stunning them in the process. Also stealing the Crystal from them and gaining Movement Speed and a Shield. 

E - Skarner thrusts his stinger in a straight line. Kind of like a thinner Illaoi Q. Slowing enemies and applying Crystal. 

R - Any enemy within 700 range who has a mark of Crystal on them, Skarner channels for 0.5 seconds and AoE Impales them all.

leagueoflegends,Maiden control change,"Hello, so i have recently began to play Yorick and i noticed that the Maiden AI is not the best (sometimes is really bad). So i was wondering if a change to her movement control has been discussed before or not.
Of course i'm not asking a total control change, like Annie's Tibber, but like a control that order the maiden to come back to you. Tbh i think that the option to let the maiden free is useless, in all the games that i have played so far i never pressed R again to let her free. 
So when pressing R in place of letting the Maiden loose i think it you should be able to recall the Maiden. Beacause rn whenever you are pushing and you hit you E when your opponent is under turret the Maiden would literally run it down and suicide under turret.
Any thoughts?

TLDR : Remove the ability to free the Maiden by pressing R(i think is useless) and add the ability to recall the Maiden to you when you press R",LordMannuqq,18/03/23 07:52:33 PM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11umdi2/maiden_control_change/

leagueoflegends,"League needs a new tutorial, per role/lane and in game context tips for players.","People shouldn't have to look up tutorials on youtube to learn the basic necessities of the game. This applies especially to jungle. Making jungle easier won't make these people suddenly know what they are doing wrong. Showing the first clear route is a decent change, but it's very surface level.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm talking minion control(aggro, freezing, slow pushing), last hitting, smiting, jungle pathing, counter jungling, ganking, objectives, split pushing. If riot put a tiny bit of effort into teaching people the game that in itself would already solve a lot of frustration when getting teammates who are lacking some crucial game knowledge, because they don't have their friends telling them or they simply didn't look it up.

&amp;#x200B;

With chat being much more restricted and less people using it in general really doesn't help either. People get to plat maining yuumi nowadays and don't have to know a single thing about the game, then they are suddenly autofilled from support into jungle and they have one champ in the role that they never played. Even if they want to try new roles at this point they are in plat elo with 0 game knowledge so fuck everyone else on their team. They don't get demoted, because as soon as they start losing they just go back to their meta pick and win a few games by simply existing.

Even if they are playing a more difficult champion, mechanical mastery will only take them so far and who knows how many games they can throw by making the incorrect decisions in every other part of the game.

&amp;#x200B;

Just my opinion I know Riot needs to focus on other more important stuff too, but people are playing the game for years and don't realize they do specific things wrong until someone tells them. A good tutorial and tips system could help a ton.",Zreks0,14/03/23 06:56:22 PM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11r31b5/league_needs_a_new_tutorial_per_rolelane_and_in/

If I'm not fast enough to cleanse an annie stun I'm just dead as lucian, even with zero followup from enemy teammates. And I can't even cleanse Vi since R is a knockup, yet I die before my spam flash even goes off. Getting caught in a bad position should be punishable I think, but I also feel like I have no agency at all now - not being able to walk anywhere even when I know where 4/5 of the enemy team is on the map. It doesn't make sense that Ahri, for example, struggles to land her e, but is often unable to 100 to 0 someone even when she does, yet champs with point and click cc are able to do this just because it is costing them an ult cc.

leagueoflegends,Don't let Riot fool you: Rework Yuumi goes against her core identity. Here's proof.,,theteaexpert,14/03/23 03:15:14 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11qinap/dont_let_riot_fool_you_rework_yuumi_goes_against/
leagueoflegends,"[Skilled Yuumi Rework] - My Yuumi Rework, the goal is more forced targetability and decision making","I thought I'd give a crack at a Yuumi rework so I thought I'd ask the Yuumi mains what they think. I think the main problem is that she is incentivised to stay on her teammates no matter what and making her choose between being stronger (but targetable) and weaker (but untargetable) should be a bigger emphasis. For some reason Riot want to make her more powerful when attached to allies with is insanity. Feel free to suggest some changes or take apart some aspects and keep some others.

Goals of my rework

1. Make her choose between external power and internal safety.
2. Make her more skill expressive but still usable for new players (Q will still do damage, E will still heal, ult will still be useful)

# Base stat changes:

No longer has gimped movement speed and attack range due to forced targetability. Base stats more inline with other enchanters.

# Passive: Magical Books (Up to 100 stacks)

Yuumi builds up stacks by moving and attacking, which grant her movement speed and increased damage on her spells as she moves outside an ally (not broken by combat). At full stacks her autos gain bonus range, damage and slow power. She retains these stacks until used from spells attached to an ally.

The aim of this is to make her more powerful the longer she manages to stay unattached. Making her choose between personal power or untargetability and ally buffs.

# Q: Staying with the theme of building up power when unattached (unattached: +20, attached: -20) 

**Suggestion 1:**

Unattached Q: Aiming system closer to current version, builds stacks if hit, AOE damage, reduces cooldown if hit incentivising to stay off ally for more damage.

Attached Q: Travels slower (closer to old version), consumes some stacks, and slows enemy, does reduced damage.

**Suggestion 2:**

Independent cooldowns

# W: Strength when attached to an ally (no longer has a cooldown, is based on stacks, need 100 to attach) 

**Suggestion 1:**

Yuumi now untargetable during second half of W when attaching (can be used to avoid damage, and first half of W when disattaching. This means she should hold off attaching to an ally for as long as possible utilising her off ally kit, and then use W to avoid a Naut hook for example (still gets caught if reacting too late). The tradeoff is she is forced off her ally after a certain amount of time.

Attaching has a stack threshold, meaning she has to do stuff off her ally to attach again.

Yuumi can disattach prematurely before being kicked off for lack of stacks, to auto and Q and build more stacks to reattach immediately and stay on for longer. This also makes her less predictable in when she will come off her ally. 

Attach to an ally for a duration giving them the bonus movement speed from your passive stacks. 

Duration is limited.

Hopefully the aim with the passive is that you build your passive, attach to an ally. When your stacks run out you are forced off your ally until you get stacks again. Attaching to an ally procs aery (from movespeed transfer). 

# E: Healing is back (unattached: +5 stacks per 10% own max hp taken, attached: -30 stacks per heal)

Unattached: 

Passive: Yuumi redirects some damage taken to her book building stacks

Active: Yuumi heals herself

Attached: 

Passive: Damage taken by anchor is split proportionally based on %max hp between Yuumi and her anchor

Active: Heal is proportionally split between Yuumi and anchor. (Yuumi not affected by anchor antiheal, or lifesteal, damage taken by shielded ally will hit unshielded Yuumi's health)

# R: Like old ult (can't change direction of waves) + more skill expression. (unattached +10 stacks per enemy per wave hit, attached no stacks lost)

**Suggestion 1:**

Make her 3 basic abilities select a wave type during her ult, kind of like an advanced Nunu E (she won't be able to cast other abilities during her ult), this could be: 

Q Waves - Slows enemy based on passive stacks (consistent but weaker), high damage relative to other waves

W Wave - Will root enemies moving towards Yuumi hit with 3 consecutive W waves (prevents chasing enemies since it only roots people running towards her),  low damage relative to other waves 

E Wave - Shields allies with a stackable shield (stacking up to 3 times), medium damage compared to other waves. Shield value increased based on stacks left. Anchored ally gains movement speed based on passive stacks remaining.

**Suggestion 2:**

Hitting more enemies per wave gives more effects:

Hit one enemy, they are slowed (prevents picking single players with a root), damage scales per stack

Hit two enemies, they are slowed and slow stacks per wave, and per passive stack

Hit three enemies, anyone caught in the 3rd consecutive wave that hits a target will be rooted (regardless of how many times they themselves have been hit)",NidhoggsEgoAccount,13/03/23 05:54:41 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11pr33j/skilled_yuumi_rework_my_yuumi_rework_the_goal_is/

leagueoflegends,Is there any use for Azir?,"I have tried to find a use for Azir but I just fail to find it, as support he falls behind compared to other more useful picks, hes only good at poking but his q's slow even, the only ability that could be useful in any way on the support role, is so weak it could even stop existing and hardly anyone would notice; on mid the only option is to play extremely defensive for 12 minutes, but if your opponent has high mobility or has any means of somehow reaching you very quickly by dashing for example, or hes an assassin like diana, then might as well go afk; I even desperately tried it on jungle but his clear time is depressing and he can't 1v1 the blue buff at lvl 3 after doing the other camps near red buff first.

&amp;#x200B;

I definitely am not a prodigy but isn't it a little bit ridiculous that its that hard to find a use for a champ while there are other champions that are stupidly easy and useful in all positions almost?

If I were to make a list of champions that are more than awesome on more than 1 lane it would take over 50% of the actual champions for sure, and many more, but Azir instead he falls short on all positions.

I acknowledge that Azir has some somewhat decent scaling, but what I mean is early game, lane phase for example, it's not about waiting 6 minutes to see some gameplay for him, but its literally waiting mid game and endgame to let Azir have an impact on the game other than knocking enemies here and there with his r (usually towards the turret because without it Azir is literally hopeless for the first 20 minutes of the game)

&amp;#x200B;

So my question is, is Azir a champion destined to be forgotten? He's definitely fun to play because of his dashes and the mobility they provide, even if his E has a cooldown so long, also his R, which I can't explain, but still.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: In Aram he's pretty solid but thats it.

leagueoflegends,Morgana mid is pretty good into Aurelion Sol,"Asol got reworked and now he's flavor of the month.  Whether that's good or bad is subjective, I personally haven't been impressed by any gold elo Aurelions, but maybe people play him well at higher elos.

Anywho, the whole problem with this guy is that he has a big AoE zone control ability and if he gets ahead, it can be hard to even approach a wave or get CS, and he's a scaling champ so if you're not stopping him from farming, he's probably going to become a win condition.  One of those ""He's supposed to be a scaling champion but for some reason also has a pretty strong lane phase?"" champs.

Riot forgot what scaling champ means at some point, but I digress.

My point is... Morgana is really good into Aurelion Sol in mid.  

Not only can she pretty much match his waveclear, but every time he goes to use his big AoE move and laser blast minions, he's a sitting duck for her QW combo, and later on for her ultimate as well.

Also, you can just press E and not care about his gravity well AoE move at all, and completely avoid any CC from his ultimate or any incoming ganks, so her laning is ultra safe.

Once you get Lost Chapter + sorc shoes, you can actually clear waves faster than he can, sustain the mana to do so, and just shove him under his tower for the rest of the game.

Once you get Liandries + Sorc Shoes, your all-in becomes lethal and he has to respect it, so he basically never gets to use his little gravity well + laser beam move to get his stacks, because every time he tries you just roast him for 30% of his HP basically for free.

Idk... Its a fun matchup, one of those that actually feels like a real counterpick, where you just have an answer for absolutely everything the champion wants to do, and they don't get to play the game at all.",squeezy102,16/03/23 05:45:35 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11sacz3/morgana_mid_is_pretty_good_into_aurelion_sol/

i like the idea of skarner being thematically territorial, the spires are weird though.

share your thoughts about skarner.

edit1: or if skarner R was like a hookshot, like vex R, but without second cast. that would make more sense than straight hooking like a blitzcrank. although it still goes against skarners feel to some length.",MovementSpeedEnjoyer,18/03/23 12:01:47 PM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11udt0q/skarner_what_if_his_r_was_a_longrange_skillshot/

leagueoflegends,"Hello, I only play Support - Take kills or leave them?","Playing this game for so many years and seeing so many things I have a few trust issues with my teammates.

I am a supp main and specifically I play only bard. I have  a tendency to never stop autoing (because of my passive damage) and never stop using spells to deal damage to my opponents.  This may result in me plenty of times taking the kills.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I understand that the kills are lovely and valuable in the hands of people who require more items, but I feel that if I stop dealing damage I am griefing and let me explain why.

Here and there I may say:

""fck it, let's let the adc have this one""

Seeing the opponent around 20 hp. you would think that my adc would do the simple thing and just auto attack and secure the kill. No, they will try to hit with a spell or do some dumb stuff and the enemy escapes.

Also many times a soraka ult might kick in and save the enemy, or some jungler might jump out of the bush and save them.

In order to combat this I never stop outputting damage. Never! Of course my objective is not to take the kill. but to not let the enemy escape.

What are your thoughts on this?

&amp;#x200B;

P.S Yesterday I tried letting my kaisa get a kill, the enemy escaped 4 times in the same fight just because kaisa was not doing any autos and BTW this is in PLAT elo!!

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: 

\- So should I stop autoing ? is that not regarded as griefing if i let the enemy survive? 

\- I don't mean flash and killing someone. I would never KS. But in fights at bot lane, I never stop outputting damage. ",sirtauntsalot,14/03/23 03:08:37 PM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11qze0p/hello_i_only_play_support_take_kills_or_leave_them/
leagueoflegends,T1 2023 Roster,"I feel there is a lot of misperception about this current T1 roster. The whole generational narrative about them choking in every bo5 or finals. I personally became a fan last year during worlds and this narrative is not doing it for me. Every YouTube comment section that has a topic of T1 and even not, this narrative is usually a hot topic. Do people always live in the past? 
Firstly this roster fully got together in 2022 after the skirmishes that happened in 2021, so I think it's not fair to associate them with the whole choking narrative. Although it can't be denied that last year they had issues especially with their drafts.
T1 this year looks stronger than last year (surprising because I feel the competition is a bit tougher now), others would say it's expected but for me, I'm heavily impressed. Argument could be that it's because they've been together for a whole year but imagine the pain and disappointment they felt from being cut short of any international success. That is what truly impresses me, being able to give another year a chance. 
Let's be honest most pros wouldn't think of running it back if they were in that situation so I accolade them.
I also think they have either the best or top 5 players in each role. Zeus and faker being contenders of top 1 or 3, Oner maybe top 1 or 3, Guma top 3 or 5 and keria who is obviously the best support and arguably best player right now and most importantly they give off that family vibe. 
Anyways, just wanted to say the whole narrative of T1 being chokers should stop because it doesn't make sense, if T1 are chokers then what do you call other teams? No team is ever going to be perfect, people should tone down their expectations a bit. And also the Faker narratives, man was probably the 2 or 3 best mid-laner last year and his performance has been ramping up and it's becoming more obvious now.

leagueoflegends,Constantly places in high level games?,"How does Draft Pick matchmaking work?

I constantly get put with people level 200+ and stand absolutely no chance, I'm still winning games but only because I'm getting my ass carried hard. Even so it's no fun losing to players with 20x my hours or getting carried by players with 20x my hours either way I spend every game dying constantly and getting flamed by my high level teammates because I'm not as good.

I only started getting into League 2-3 weeks ago and have played 37 hours.

What's worse is because I play ADC a lot of the time my support will realise I'm not very good early on then just decide I'm not worth the headache and go play in another lane (I don't mean they roam a bit I mean they will straight ditch me for the rest of the game).",RicherConpon,15/03/23 08:12:43 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11rfkrf/constantly_places_in_high_level_games/
leagueoflegends,Made it to Masters after failing promos 7x AMA!,"The previous post was deleted for not making the word count, But I'd love to keep answering questions! 

Failed promos 7x in total since last season and today it finally ends. For the first time in a while, I got through an entire 3 game series without someone running it down, which happened to me in the previous 6.

Honestly excited to go play other games or do anything else at this point, but more than happy to give anyone climbing tips.

leagueoflegends,Seraphine could be the Classical Hero with the old Skarner's lore,"TLDR: best described by T B Skyen in his Seraphine series:

[https://www.youtube.com/@TBSkyen/search?query=seraphine](https://www.youtube.com/@TBSkyen/search?query=seraphine)

One is not born a Hero, one has to become the Hero.

And Seraphine &amp; Skarner lore predicament is the perfect stage for a Classical Hero's Journey.

\- Seraphine lives in an ""Ordinary Wolrd"" and believes a ""Set of Lies"" - Hextech is considered a force for good and the public does not even suspect the true nature of the Crystals.

\- Her Brakern powered device and her empathic ability to hear their emotions is her ""Call to Adventure"" - once she learns that that innocent souls are used in the Hextech she will have to act.

\- Skarner may play a role of a ""Herald"" that takes her on said adventure during which she will overcome her initial limitations and will become the Hero. 

\- Camille may play a role of a ""Dragon"" - she's an assassin for a noble house that uses Hextech to enrich themselves who could be the actual bad guys - a stand in for a soul-less megacorp. As hinted in Camille's own lore she's becoming more and more distanced from her ""relatives"" who treat her more as a ""tool"". Seraphine's empathy and ability to invoke it may be the thing that causes Camille to change for better in the end, return to her Humanity and make the right chocie.

&amp;#x200B;

Riot, this is **LITERALLY A PERFECT CANVAS** for a good story. Yasuo got his redemption story arc, Riven got her redemption story arc, let Seraphine get her Hero's Journey. 

This can be a later Season of Arcane once Jinx&amp;Vi or Jayce&amp;Viktor plot lines are resolved. A return to the Piltover&amp;Zaun after X years timeskip and several Seasons in other places.

This can have a good moral about how people treat environment, how greed makes people walk over other people's plight and how personal ambitions conflict with the good of the many. 

This can have a good song that reinforces the fact that not all is evil that looks scary - Skarner looks monstrous to us humans but in fact it is us humans who are the monsters to the Brakern.

This is just pure potential.",Nick-Dzink,18/03/23 07:17:26 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11u7dpw/seraphine_could_be_the_classical_hero_with_the/

leagueoflegends,League has changed as people are surrendering too easily these days especially low elo,"I have been playing this game since 2010, just as a casual player (low elo) and the game has changed when it comes to surrendering. I find that now people are not willing to challenge themselves and fight more skilled opponents. If it is a little too hard everyone clicks the surrender button so quickly. I miss those games where we fight to the very end until nexus is destroyed. Sometimes even turning the game around (so fun). I don't care if we lose because I just want to play. Now I keep getting teammates that surrender at 20 mins mark before I even get to start doing something.  What is the point of playing the game if you are going to just surrender at 20 mins. Remember you can't always get an easy game every time.",stalik26,13/03/23 09:35:53 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11pwdst/league_has_changed_as_people_are_surrendering_too/
leagueoflegends,When did the LCS studio turn into a circus?,"I used to watch every LCS split but at some point a few years ago I just kind of drifted away from the game and the competitive scene.  I recently started watching again after missing quite a few seasons (I honestly don't know how many) and was pretty shocked at how much things had changed on the broadcast.

I remember the production used to kind of mirror a traditional sports broadcast.  Obviously it was always a little less serious than that with casters/analysts being quicker to meme and joke around, but it definitely had a foundation that was fairly grounded/serious.

Now I tune in and I'm watching a bunny amble around while people arm wrestle and the analysts are dressed up as literal clowns.  Perhaps the most shocking one was a week or two ago when they were presenting a flowchart of CLG's win conditions that was primarily focused on the size of a player's bowel movements.

What on earth happened?  What was the turning point?  Was it a gradual change or did they flip the script over night at some point?

Edit: I know sometimes people get a bit defensive if they think something they like is getting attacked, so I just want to be clear that's not my intent.  At the end of the day these are two very different styles of presentation/entertainment, there's nothing inherently wrong with either.  I will admit that the ""small poo poo / big sh*t"" flowchart truly baffled me, but I don't necessarily hate the other stuff I've seen - I'm just genuinely very confused/curious as to how it changed so much.

Edit 2: Got my answer(s), seems like viewership has been dipping and these changes are relatively new and probably an attempt to spice things up or attract a new audience.  Thanks to those who realized I was asking a genuine question and contributed to the conversation!",AtheismoAlmighty,17/03/23 10:14:02 PM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11ts9wn/when_did_the_lcs_studio_turn_into_a_circus/
leagueoflegends,[satire] The reason why Yuumi is the way she is," 

Once upon a time, in the bustling headquarters of Riot Games, the creative minds behind the massively popular game, League of Legends, were hard at work. The design and balance team, responsible for crafting new and exciting champions, had been tasked with creating something truly unique and different. They wanted to challenge the status quo, to push the boundaries of what a champion could be and offer players an experience unlike any other.

For weeks, the team brainstormed, debated, and explored countless ideas, searching for the perfect concept that would shake up the game and captivate the hearts and minds of players worldwide. Then, one fateful day, inspiration struck: a magical cat with the power to heal and protect its allies, all while being virtually untouchable. And so, Yuumi, the Magical Cat, was born.

The design team poured their hearts and souls into Yuumi, carefully crafting her abilities, appearance, and lore. They wanted to ensure that she was not only unique but also balanced and fun to play. But as they playtested the champion, they soon realized that they had created a monster.

Yuumi's untargetable gameplay, while certainly unique, proved to be a nightmare for balance. Players found her incredibly frustrating to play against, as her ability to attach to allies made her almost invulnerable to attacks. On the flip side, many players also found her boring to play, as her role was primarily focused on healing and shielding her teammates rather than engaging in dynamic and exciting combat.

As complaints from players flooded in, the design team faced a difficult decision. They could either rework Yuumi, addressing her unfun gameplay and making her a more engaging and satisfying champion to play and face, or they could double down on her uniqueness, preserving her untargetable gameplay at the risk of further alienating players.

Despite the mounting backlash, the design team was strangely attached to Yuumi. There was something about the magical cat that seemed to enthrall them, a mystifying allure that they couldn't quite put their finger on. And so, against their better judgment, they chose to keep her untargetable gameplay, opting instead to simply swap her heals and shields around and make her even more powerful.

The rework was met with mixed reactions from the League of Legends community. While some players appreciated the changes and the design team's commitment to preserving Yuumi's uniqueness, others were dismayed by their refusal to address the core issues with her gameplay. But despite the criticism, the design team stood firm in their decision, convinced that they had made the right choice.

As time went on, however, it became increasingly clear that something was amiss within the design team. Their once-clear vision and commitment to balance and fun seemed to be clouded by an inexplicable obsession with Yuumi. They devoted more and more time and resources to the magical cat, often at the expense of other champions and aspects of the game. It was as if they were under some sort of spell, driven to protect and adore Yuumi at all costs.

Then, one day, a shocking revelation came to light: the design team had been infected with Toxoplasmosis, a parasitic infection known to cause changes in behavior and, in some cases, even mind control. The parasite, it seemed, had somehow made its way into the team's bloodstream, causing them to become irrationally enamored with Yuumi and determined to keep her in the game, despite the mounting evidence of her negative impact on the player experience.

As the truth of their condition spread throughout Riot Games, the company was faced with a difficult decision. They could either quarantine the design team, hoping to find a cure for their affliction while potentially losing their most creative minds, or they could allow them to continue their work on Yuumi, risking the further degradation of the game they had all worked so hard to create.

In their toxoplasmosis-induced haze, the design team began to concoct a sinister plan. If the entire world were infected with the parasite, then everyone would share their unyielding love for Yuumi. They believed that by spreading Toxoplasmosis far and wide, they could unite players in their adoration of the magical cat, creating a world where Yuumi was universally cherished and celebrated.

As the plan took shape, the design team worked tirelessly, using their knowledge and resources to devise methods for disseminating the parasite on a global scale. They knew that time was of the essence, as their secret could be discovered at any moment, putting an end to their nefarious scheme.

But amidst the chaos and deception, a glimmer of hope emerged. One of the designers, who had managed to recover from the infection, discovered the truth about the team's twisted plot. Horrified by what he had learned, he knew that he had to act quickly to put a stop to their plans and save not only the game he loved but also the countless lives that would be affected by the worldwide spread of Toxoplasmosis.

In a desperate bid to expose the conspiracy and rally support against the design team's machinations, the recovered designer began to spread word of the situation to anyone who would listen. He penned a letter, detailing the harrowing events that had transpired within the hallowed halls of Riot Games and imploring readers to help him put an end to the madness before it was too late.

Dear reader, it is with a heavy heart and a deep sense of urgency that I share this story with you. I am that designer, and I have seen firsthand the havoc that Toxoplasmosis has wrought upon my colleagues and the beloved game of League of Legends. I fear that if we do not act soon, the entire world will be ensnared in Yuumi's bewitching grasp, and the consequences will be catastrophic.

I implore you to join me in my quest to stop the spread of Toxoplasmosis and save our game from the clutches of the Yuumi-obsessed design team. Together, we can expose the truth, restore balance to League of Legends, and ensure that the world remains free from the sinister influence of the magical cat.

But time is running out. The design team's plan is already in motion, and each day brings us closer to a world where Yuumi reigns supreme. If you are reading this, please know that your help is desperately needed, and your actions could make all the difference.

Will you join me in this fight, and help to save the game we all love from the jaws of disaster? The fate of League of Legends, and the world, hangs in the **balance**.",AlllRkSpN,15/03/23 05:22:00 PM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11rr8k3/satire_the_reason_why_yuumi_is_the_way_she_is/

leagueoflegends,Duo queue has no place in ranked soloqueue. It is an unfair practice in a competitive environment and defeats the purpose of Flex queue.,"Last year there was some discussion of duo queue in ranked soloqueue where Riot mentioned it would be improved upon rather than removed. I don't feel like it has improved at all and maintain it should be removed.

**Ranked is intended to be a competitive match mode and it should be fair. I don't think there is a situation where allowing duo queue to be part of SOLOqueue ranked is fair.** 

People who want to team up should have to do so in normals or flex. 

If Riot insist on keeping parties in low elo soloqueue then can we at least have stricter enforcement of role-matchmaking. If people who team up have to wait an extra minute or two then that should be the cost of teaming up.",sakawaa,14/03/23 11:40:03 PM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11r9i66/duo_queue_has_no_place_in_ranked_soloqueue_it_is/

C9/FLY - Top 2 locked for both. C9 controls their own destiny and gets first seed if they beat CLG. Otherwise, FLY has to beat TSM to force a tiebreaker for 1st/2nd.  

EG - If they beat TL, they lock 3rd. Otherwise, they will play tiebreakers if CLG/GG/100 win. Could finish anywhere from 3rd-6th. 

GG/CLG/100 - For these teams, if they win they're in and guarantee playoffs (with tiebreakers for seeding in most scenarios). However, if they lose they would have to play tiebreakers and they could fall out of playoffs in some scenarios. This group could finish 3rd-7th. 

TSM - Have to beat FLY to have any hope. If they lose, they're eliminated. If they win, they need help (multiple of GG/CLG/100 to lose) to play tiebreakers.  They can finish 4th-7th. 

DIG/IMT/TL are eliminated.

There could be anywhere from 0-5 tiebreaker games.",vmanAA738,18/03/23 03:19:24 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11u0uq5/lcs_spring_2023_final_playoffseeding_scenarios/
leagueoflegends,Do you ever see old patch notes and marvel at how much more effort was put into the game each patch?,"Riot used to work SO MUCH harder on the game.

[Patch 5.8](https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/V5.8) (just look at balance changes, ignoring Ryze rework)  
[Patch 5.6](https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/V5.6) (just look at balance changes, ignoring URF)

This is season 5, after their tweaking of the game had already significantly slowed down relative to even earlier seasons.

[Patch 4.5](https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/V4.5) (look at all of this. Multiple in-depth tweaks of champs' entire kits)  
[Patch 4.4](https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/V4.4) (again, multiple in-depth tweaks to multiple champs' kits)

Season 4 they're doing EVEN MORE each patch. These are BEFORE the ""class-wide"" updates in seasons 6/7 even started.

You could tell they cared about the game so much more, always hitting things that **felt** off, always trying to improve. Now they mostly buff stuff doesn't need a buff, but isn't played enough because of several other champs being too strong and 15% pickrate, or *maybe* touch something in a patch if they're blatantly broken (or maybe next patch, who knows :) ).

If you think I'm cherry picking, you can check all of the surrounding patches. They're pretty much ALL like this. Don't show T1 or he might have an aneurism over the current balance/design team again.

You know what means, the race is really on! With playoff spots now coming at a premium, here’s who’re trying their hardest to make sure their team gets those seats:

**MVP of the Week:**

https://preview.redd.it/u3rg1hjwrmna1.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=3a77aa5a84398a0cfa18db84079a93f6b91d1bbf

EDG won not one, not two, but three series last week - solidifying their playoff seed to be at least into Round 2, and placing them at the top of the LPL rankings. Much of the success has to be attributed to their amazing jungler, Jiejie, who came up clutch consistently in helping them scrape out both of their close 2-1 series. A rock that serves as the foundation for continued EDG success, he certainly deserves his place here this week.

**Rookie of the Week:**

https://preview.redd.it/asgkc9xxrmna1.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=67c435ef71ba30561bfe9eb53ab752e41218608c

If there’s one team that made some incredible noise in the past week, it would be LGD. Having been counted out by many analysts and fans, there was little expectation for them coming into a week where they had to play the giants of EDG and TES. Little did they know how much of a fight this man here would put up.

In both their shocking sweep against Top Esports and their hard-fought loss against EDG, Xiaoxu performed incredibly, helping keep LGD’s heads above water deep into long, close games. We hope for their continued success - both LGD and Xiaoxu.

**Positional Standouts:**

https://preview.redd.it/4z7b2dqyrmna1.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=d216a2406b2a630811526a3e7b0dea8bb7621078

A week doesn’t go by without Scout getting another award. And it’s not hard to see why. LNG also had their fun in pummeling TES, and went close against JDG. And none of it would be possible without him. On the flipside WE’s Hope is a welcome surprise to the lineup - after bot presences brought the team two sweeps last week.

Ming and Ale round it out, with the former always being in contention and the latter being crucial alongside JieJie in EDG’s great week.

With the playoff race in full swing, who will claim the titles in Week 9? Tune in and find out!

leagueoflegends,yuumi's W should have an addictive mana cost,"like, a cost that is at 1 mana cost the first second, and for each seconds the yuumi stay on her anchor, the anchor receive 1 stacks of idk what should be called and for each stack on the anchor, the mana cost of yuumi's w rise of 1 on this anchor, a stack disappear each second when yuumi isn't anchored on the marked allie, and lose all stacks when either yuumi or the allie died. when yuumi don't have enough mana, she detach herself.

one it make yummi not staying on a champion too long,

two it extend the time yuumi would be staying out in lane without hinder the ability to jump between allies in teamfight,

three it force yuumi on support mana regen items so we don't have those full ap yuumi that one Q deals half of the life of an adc.

then give back the ability for yuumi to regen some mana for herself with auto and the cat would be on the right spot. maybe give her a tiny little bit of move speed so it can go ward

it allows a yuumi staying on a champion without using spells and without items for 30 seconds at lvl 1 and 60 seconds at lvl 18 until her mana is depleted, more than enough most of the time.

moreover, it encourage interactivity of the player playing yuumi and gives plenty of time for the enemy team for counter play.

in the same time this keep the core mechanic of this cat being un-targetable most of time a conditional true.

[This thread was created by the Post-Match Team](https://postmatch.team).",adz0r,14/03/23 09:24:55 PM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11r6176/ninjas_in_pyjamascn_vs_invictus_gaming_lpl_2023/
leagueoflegends,I think there is a middle ground to balance GP and make him less frustrating for both the player AND the opponent.,"TLDR: barrels should scale off of crit strike chance instead of bonus crit effectiveness (think like rengar Q, Ashe passive, navori quickblades) passive should lose its crit damage scaling and gain more movespeed based on critical strike chance. IMO Gangplank should be a hit and run character likes he was in seasons prior AND lose the ability to one shot people at 20% crit (just essence reaver) because it’s ridiculous when it happens.

First off I’m a 1.4 mil GP player that can admit GANGPLANK WAS BONKERS TIER FOR A LONG LONG TIME. The nerfs are justified and I’m not trying to say “GP IS TOO WEAK NOW PLZ BUFF” but the nerfs didn’t change on what the people I play vs HATE and I think there’s a middle ground yet to be achieved.

I’m obviously not some balance guru I simply just know the ins and outs of GP and would love some feedback on how people feel about purposed changes. Maybe I’m on to something, maybe I’m  just a moron OTP that needs his champ s+ tier to climb. 

They target nerfed GPs passive by 60 base damage at level 18, but kept the crit scaling (100% crit = 200 bonus true damage) this is problem #1, full glass cannon GP does not want to go in smacking people, his passive suggests that’s the “gameplan” so they make it hit like a like truck. 

1. Navori should NOT increase its damage, I don’t know why this still works like this, true damage shouldn’t be able to “amped” nor “weakened”
 
2. If riot wants GP to be glass cannon we don’t need more stat stick damage at all, glass cannon GP CANNOT/SHOULD NOT be going blow for blow on bruisers/assassins.

I suggest GP passive gets movespeed per % of critical strike chance, instead of the bonus damage per % crit chance. Glass cannon GP needs to be able to kite and run circles around people, not slap em for 1k true damage because “they got too close”. Gangplank in season 10 use to get 60 ms on slapping a barrel because of triforce, we lost that interaction (most build essence reaver) AND now it scales from 15%-30%. I feel the insane damage stems from the fact that I can’t run away anymore so now I just hold my ground and smack people with my flaming stat stick.

NOTE: if the movespeed is too much, make it only get it’s increased movespeed after slapping a keg NOT just using passive on something. 

My next suggestion is to make barrels DAMAGE scale off % crit chance BUT can no longer crit (Rengar Q, Ashe passive, Navori quickblades)  

NOTE: at 100% crit chance should do about the same amount damage as he does now, I’m suggesting the change so he doesn’t randomly do 1k damage just off essence reaver alone, and makes my damage more linear and NOT random.

Nobody likes getting one shot but phreak explained that bruiser GP cannot be balanced for solo Q and not be 100% pick/ban in competitive play. They need to find a middle ground with Critplank and I think I have a solution. 

If barrels damage scale off % crit chance for its damage, it means Gangplank will get proportionally stronger after every purchase instead of only 20-80% of the time. It sucks for my lane opponents to get 1 shot them level 9 because I rolled the 20%. It sucks for the GP player when the big 3 man barrel does 600 damage instead of 1500 because we didn’t get the 80% chance to crit :(.

I feel a linear scaling will make Gangplank more “predictable” for BOTH sides and just overall less frustrating. 

I’m not going to suggest numbers, I’m biased and will be too generous to my main champion. There are other people more qualified to do that then me. Let me know what y’all think about this? I know people HATE GP I get it, no way to make everyone happy but I THINK we can make everyone less frustrated about the champ.",SageSpliter,12/03/23 11:16:47 PM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11pgy0q/i_think_there_is_a_middle_ground_to_balance_gp/

leagueoflegends,"Probably a stupid idea, but what if 5 drakes were needed for Soul, and each drake ""Stat Buff"" was a bit less strong?","# Problem to solve: 

&gt;Drakes being by far the most important thing on the map, due to their stats, and especially Soul, which pushes the game to a Perma Bot-Lane fight who isn't fun for anyone.

1. Botlaners get their lane turned into a shitfest.
2.  Toplaners have 0 impact for 20 minutes and are mostly ignored
3.  Junglers are forced to play botside
4.  Midlaners are paranoid and must play for bot Roams.

# How would 5 drakes fix this?

&gt;A few things would change by adding an extra drake and making each singular drake a bit less powerful.

1. Fighting for each single drake would be less important, as each team would need more to reach soul, opening up opportunities to play for Top/Mid instead of always trying to get bot ahead to contest dragons.
2. As a direct effect of this, ADCs would have a more chill lane, and have time to scale and farm, instead of playing hide and seek from Junglers and Mid Assassins every game. This would lead to more consistent ADC performance and also make ADCs have more agency in their own lane, since Mid/JGL won't be perma bot.
3. Support would get more opportunities to Roam, as in a slower game, where Bot isn't the absolute top Priority, they are free to go and mess around more, making plays happen.
4. Same thing for Junglers, also opens up for Farming Junglers, since they won't lose as much from not being able to Gank early/Take early drakes.
5. Toplane would become more relevant as FIghting early drakes wouldn't be as important, so playing for Topside/Herald would be much more worth it
6. Game would be overall less snowbally, as losing 1 fight/1 drake, doesn't instantly spell doom for your team, because enemies will need to get 1 extra drake for that sweet sweet soul. Giving time for losing team to recuperate and come back.

# Ok, but what happens to soul? Won't it be way less likely for a team to get Soul? YES!

&gt;This in my book is a good Thing! Why?

**Because since they will be much more rare, they can be made more interesting and powerful, because they will be a much less frequent Win-Con and thus can be allowed more power/gimmicks! Kinda like Elder is Absolutely OP, but since it is VERY rare to get to it, it is fine.**

&amp;#x200B;

# Ok, what about the drakes themselves?

&gt;This would entirely depend on how strong Riot wants Drake stacking to be!

If i had to choose, i'd lower each drake ""Stat buffs"" a bit, so again, they aren't absolutely the most important thing ever, but at the same time, Stacking even just 3 of them is an advantage that is worthwhile still!",NotoriusV,19/03/23 06:36:42 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11v3458/probably_a_stupid_idea_but_what_if_5_drakes_were/

leagueoflegends,Asol's E needs the execute taken off,"I dont say this because A sol's execute does too much damage. I say this because he has a basically guaranteed way to get back into the game every single game by dropping it under a teamfight and praying he gets shutdowns.

Asol's E allows him to net way too many priority shutdowns, even from death. The amount of times i've seen an 0-7 asol die first in a teamfight then land a double/triple kill from death because 3 people died on his E for 2k gold in shutdowns is absurd. Executing minions makes some sense, but it should not be an execute on champions. 

It's a comeback for free card that's allowing him to abuse the bounty system and come online way to quick. Sure, he should be a late game carry, but as of right now he only needs two VERY cheap items to carry (ROA+Rylais) and he is all but GUARANTEED to hit those items when he gets every single kill during a teamfight with his E.",NotT14NotRankedButBL,19/03/23 04:35:52 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11uzpmo/asols_e_needs_the_execute_taken_off/

leagueoflegends,Skin ideas for every champ - N,"Hello everyone!

Let us carry on with today's letter, N.

**Nami**

*Astronami*: Since we arrived to 'N', I realised that there might be other champs with N, who can fulfill the same pun as Astronautilus. I know she has a cosmic skin aaand a program one already, which latter is kinda similar in visuals, so I'm not entirely sure of the whole concept.

*Cafe Cuties*: She is indeed cute plus you can colour her spell effects to fit the theme like with Vlad.

*Lunar Empress*: No idea lol just found it somewhat fitting, maybe it's not.

*Giant Enami/Prehistoric*: A prehistoric style gigantic shark monster. :D Kinda like Ripjaws from Ben 10 xddd

**Nasus**

*Astronasus (aka Laika)*: The other candidate for the pun.

*Good boy nasus*: Listen. I know he has Space Groove, with the little doggo, that's really good, I admit it, thumbs up. And he has Archduke, that's good too, no denying. But none of those two justify the fact, that you LEFT HIM OUT OF THE CATS VS DOGS SKIN LINE. THERE IS PRETTY. KITTY. RENGAR!!! WHERE IS GOOD BOI NASUS??? DO YOU HEAR ME RIOT?! WHERE IS-

Kh-hm, apologies. Moving on.

*Dark Star*: I find it really fitting. Put a black hole in his staff and every time he Q's, the life force is consumed by the bh and that's how he stacks. E could be basically a galaxy. And the R... 'd be sick.

*Urf Champion*: Same idea as it was with Jax. Urf costume, spatule for weapon. Actually it probably fits Nasus more than Jax, cause the spatule is a little closer to his staff than Jax's lantern and Nasus is more 'iconic' if you could say that, in urf cause he can stack much faster.

*Freljord*: Put together Braum and Tundra Hunter Warwick. There you have it.

**Nautilus**

*Mecha Kingdoms*: A giant mecha nautilus emerging from the sea, sounds like it could work, to me.

*Elderwood*: Wooden body, anchor is twisted roots, couple of leaves here and there.

*Victorious*: Haven't used this skin line before, so thought, why not. I imagine it as something like a prestige version to Warden.

**Neeko**

*Arcanist*: Somewhere between Arcanist Zoe and Bewitching Neeko. Little trickster mage.

*Beeko*: No idea how it would look like, but I like it.

*Definitely Not Neeko*: Pretty sure it's not just me who came up with this idea, but that just shows more how good of a concept it is. It's just fun and fits her character perfectly.

*Dragoneeko*: She's technically a cameleon, that's technically a lizard and dragons are technically big lizards. Can't argue with this.

*Prehistoric/Dino*: Similar idea, either a real or a Dino Gnar kinda dinosaur. I already hear her say ""Rawwwrr!"" in her voice.

*Space Groove*: Fun, goofy skin line, perfect for Neeko.

**Nidalee**

*Battle Cougar*: Anima Squad skin, a shapeshifter superhero, I think it works.

*Blood Moon*: Cool skin line, cool champ, can't really explain it better than that.

*Wildclaw*: DnD/Rift Quest type of skin. In dnd there are druids who usually can turn into animals, that's why I thought of it. Name can be changed.

**Nilah**

She only has Star Guardian so far and I really like her and she's a good material anyways, so I gave her a couple more than usual:

*Explorer*: Indiana Jones!

*Arclight*: A wip of light.

*Battle Queen*: Like Kata and Diana. Even by lore she is a mighty fighter, works well I believe.

*Lion Tamer*: Self-explanatory.

*Sandstorm*: Indiana Jones but more shuriman. Like Sandstorm Katarina with a whip and sand spell effects.

*High Noon*: The whip works here too.

*Ruined*: Evil joy. Would really be interested lore-wise, what would happen if she became ruined. They could let her hair out.

*Dawnbringer*: Just a cool hero skin for her. Could have really nice spell effects. Might try white hair with this one.

*Invincible Dragon*: A dragonmancer skin. This could be absolutely badass. Could give any element or colour theme really.

**Nocturne**

*Dark Star*: Dark theme, good for Noc. I imagine the Q would look really cool with cosmic particles.

*Sand Wraith*: Surprised he doesn't have a skin like this yet. His ghostly body could be made out of sand and his blades wouldn't be as dumb as they usually are. Imagine Sand Wraith Pyke without legs and his dagger on both of his arms. Kinda like that.

*Blood Moon*: Kinda fitting. Assassins always work with BM.

**Nunu &amp; Willump**

*Trick-or-Treat*: As always, snowball is a jack-o'-lantern. Eating an enemy with Q shows a little candy emblem like how Final Boss Veigar shows the Rylai's. Nunu is perfect for trick-or-treating anyways. They could wear different costumes based on the chroma, the bossibilities are endless.

*Fuzz Friends*: Willump is a cat rolling a big yarn ball, Nunu wears a little dog/cat costume.

*Sweeper*: Snowball is a football. If it hits someone it makes a ""Goal!"" sound effect.

&amp;#x200B;

Finally done. See you nect time! :)",lissandrafootjob,13/03/23 04:35:36 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11pp36q/skin_ideas_for_every_champ_n/

leagueoflegends,Do all the extremely low elo people end up playing with eachother constantly like high elo?,"I mean like, the bottom 200 players in every region. 

If you didn't know. The top of the solo q ladder is rather lonely, because your MMR is so high, only a few players can actually match with you, or they should, at least in theory. Sometimes the queues go too long and you end up finding new people who aren't as high rated, like, maybe you only get a GM Jungler against their 600 LP Challenger, but it's better to get that than not even get to play at all.

If you watch high elo streams, you will realize all the pros and soloQ monsters kinda just end up playing with eachother pretty much all the time. When you find an account name you don't recognize, it's often another pro in an alt account.

Either way, you get the idea.

But what happens at the bottom of the ladder? Like, the whole thing is a spectrum. Most people are right in the middle, which is about High Silver.

The true depths of Iron. When you get to Iron, and you lose, and you get to Iron 4, and you lose, and you get to 0 LP, and you keep pressing further, losing and losing over and over again.

You eventually cross the Event Horizon, no? A place where only you and players like you reside, completely closed out to the people on the outside.

leagueoflegends,"A few months into 2023, how do you feel about 2022’s champion releases?","So now that it’s March and the initial feeling of “Zeri can run around and mach 10 with 3k health and normal ADC damage” or “K’Sante keeps oneshotting me” have faded, how do you feel about last years champion releases? Are they 200 years extremely frustrating to play against or fairly reasonable and fun? I’ve included my own (biased) takes below but am mostly curious what the community thinks.

————-

Zeri: Zeri has definitely proven to be a major challenge for Riot’s balance team, but I feel like she has settled into a fairly healthy niche for solo queue, even if her numbers are kept weak. Her core mechanic of skillshot autos makes her feel fair to fight and I think Riot has found a healthy spot for her power distribution between abilities. It’s probably also worth noting that she and K’Sante are the only releases that haven’t been consistently strong in the meta since their release.

Renata: Renata was my personal favorite release from last year due mostly to her theming and ultimate. I think her power budget is generally well allocated and she is overall healthy for the game. My one complaint is that even though her revive hasn’t proven to be OP, I still would have preferred if they had given her something else on her W, but that’s just my personal preference coming from other enchanters.

Bel’Veth: Bel’Veth is definitely my least favorite of last year’s releases, largely due to my initial expectations of a “void jungler that carefully plans things” as being a mage or highly technical assassin and because of how much of her power is in her E. Aside from my personal letdown that we weren’t getting a true mage jungler like I had hoped for, she feels very stat-checky for a recent champion to me. The only real change that I would want to see in her kit would be a change to her E to make it scaling, CC interruptible, or significantly reduce her damage. Whenever I play as or against her, it normally feels like E up = she wins and E down = she’s going to have to use her dashes to book it out of the fight.

Nilah: I feel like I never see her get played, even though she’s generally a strong pick with reliable scaling. My theory is that this is because she fills a niche very few people were asking for. Most ADC players don’t want to play a skirmisher, but she also isn’t a lane bully who can stomp you early without knowing a lot about botlane already. I was initially skeptical of her ally dodge ability, but it’s short duration and long cooldown seem to keep it in check. She should be fine as long as she continues to be a niche pick balanced around being played by her mains.

K’Sante: I have very little to say about this man overall. I don’t play much toplane and he hasn’t been very popular since his nerfs over the winter. When I do see him in my games, he is pretty unproblematic. To me he feels like Ornn if he prioritized skirmishes over teamfights. A strong release that finally gave us a new toplane tank after years.

Overall I feel that last years releases were much stronger than 2021’s, with clearer weaknesses and counterplay while keeping the dynamic, fast-paced feeling Riot has been pushing for since the late 2010s.

leagueoflegends,A newcomer's from Dota first experience,"I've been playing Dota for quite some time now (8k hours), but recently [Gaben showed yet again how little he cares about the game](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/11kh9ru/the_dead_reckoning_update_hola_muerta_gameplay/), so I decided to switch to LoL for a month or two.

From the get-go, I struggled with the client's settings and was trying for like half an hour to make the client fullscreen, only to fail miserably. Seriously, the whole thing took me more than 2 hours to set up (mostly thanks to camera unlock not working properly in tutorial, which led me to think my game was bugged). 

After playing my first two games with Miss Fortune (ofc with bots), I started my first MM game, where I got my ass handed to me by Evelynn, so now I am a sweaty Eve main :p. And here is what my multiplayer experience was like after 2 days of playing:

\-The game itself seems really fast-paced, and the fights that take place usually end in 10 seconds or so, since everyone either oneshots an enemy, or dies to a oneshot;

\-I still haven't figured out (and didn't bother to look up on wiki) what buffs most of the bosses provide. I noticed that the crab thingy on top fights for your side, and the dragons empower your heroes in some ways (and apparently create warpers on your base or smth), but overall it is not clear what bosses to kill and when, since I don't know my limits yet and if it is worth it;

\-Overall it's quite refreshing to experince a lot of new mechanics and peculiarities, for example the almost complete abscence of stuns (in dota almost every hero can stun for upwards of 2 sec, and the fights last at least for 20 seconds or even longer), shared skills like flash and smite, bushes and so on;

P.S: Dota overwhelms you with mechanics the first time you play, and it really really takes a lot of time to get used to(denies, couriers, smoke ganks, stacks, aggro and the list goes on and on), whereas here it is manageable, and you can enjoy the gameplay more and sooner;

\-The game is very tricky when it comes to escaping ganks, so if you get jumped by 2 or more heroes it is almost certainly a death, at least from my experince. Imo it's best to just try to avoid ganks by playing the map correctly.

There were a few problems I encountered other than the settings:

1)The most annoying thing is the queue and load time, leavers and match restarts after someone quits during the draft. It often took me way over than 30 minutes to start a proper game (which would then usually end in 15 minutes, but more about that later). It seems to me that, whatever a penalty there is, it is not quite strict enough, and the loading screens lasting over close to 2 minutes is just insane imo.

2)The 'surrender' guys. There were a lot of players who fed their lanes and then spammed surrender for the rest of the game, which killed all the remaining morale and will to play on.  If their attempts to surrender ended up in vain, they would often just leave, resulting in the aforementioned  15-20 min ffs.

3) It seems almost impossible to play from behind, there is no (as I understand) comeback mechanics other than a small added bounty for kill streaks. And it's hard to utilize even that, beacause enemies just stack as five and end the game.

4) Voice chat?

In conclusion, LoL is a lot less compelx compared to Dota and although I'd like to have couriers, fast buy and denies, I am still not sure if this relative simplicity is a bad thing, it just takes time to get used to I guess. The game seems to be alive and one can really enjoy it fully, even despite the weird MM stuff. 

I hope when I get to ranked (I'm level 17 now) the problems with MM will go way at least partially.",Used_Arm_3873,12/03/23 01:53:56 PM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11p6tf0/a_newcomers_from_dota_first_experience/

leagueoflegends,Apparently there's a Double Aegis build on K'Sante?,"So apparently Korean soloQ K'Sante's are going Double Aegis? 

Was looking up LoL Wiki to see how this would work.

--- 
Jak'Sho - Aegis (1200) + Kindle (800) + Ruby (400) + 800g = 3200g

*If you go Jak'sho, you get 30 armor, 30 magic resist, 400 health, 20 ability haste.*

---

Double Aegis - 1200 + 1200

You have 800g extra to spend it on either Ninja Tabi because of the Free Boots Rune OR 2 Ruby Crystals.

Double Ruby Crystals sound like a good option because Jak'Sho Recipe is Kindle + Ruby. So you're already building into it.

Kindle only gives 200 health. Double Ruby Crystals give 300 health. 

*If you go the Double Aegis Build with 2 Ruby Crystals, that's 60 armor, 60 magic resist, 300 health, 20 ability haste*

leagueoflegends,"Insensitive Emote Name ""Shock and Awe""","I was just browsing through the TFT section in the client when I stumbled upon this emote which was named ""shock and awe"" and it was kind of off-putting.

I know Riot has a record for advocating for social progress and humanitarian aid, so naturally I was taken aback to see an emote name which referenced (in a lighthearted manner) one of the most tragic humanitarian crises in the last 20 years.

An integral component of the U.S' military strategy in the midst of the Iraq war was to devastate civilian infrastructure, including water sanitation plants, power plants, roads, bridges, hospitals, etc. This type of strategy is a direct violation of international law, and widely regarded as a war crime. Furthermore, there was no justified incentive for the U.S to go to war in Iraq, since there was never any evidence of weapons of mass destruction, thus that premise was merely a fabrication.

In my opinion naming an emote with a reference to such a tragic and morbid conflict trivializes its severity and diminishes the recognition that people have for the lives lost and the destruction that was caused by it.",Pandini23,18/03/23 12:05:39 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11tvcmn/insensitive_emote_name_shock_and_awe/

leagueoflegends,What was your worst ranked experience in League?,"Question is simple, what was it?

For me;

I quit the league for a while like 2-3 years ago, an old dia stuck player, and i wanted to play on low elo to warm up. And my friend had a bronze 3 Stuck account and said ""use this and if you can, make it gold for me, pls"" and i was like yeah sure (big mistake).

Dude, grinding from Bronze 3 STUCK account was just torture. Getting 10-11 LP for wins and losing 20-25 for a loss is just too painful. I grinded it to plat 4 and never even played in my OG account after that, for the rest of the season. Got PTSD vibes from those period lol.

If you wonder, you need to win at least 100 games WITHOUT LOSING with that LP income (10\*100=1000lp to get plat nearly at least) AND when i lost due to having trolls or toxic players that means i need to win 2 games to replace that loss it was like hell. I would never go near to a ""gold or below account"" again, like NEVER. But at the same time i practised so many different champions and it was kinda worth i guess? Anyway as i said not fun in the end. And i swear, when i reached plat, i was about to cry from happiness due to playing with so many mental low elo players that are incredibly toxic if you ask me. I mean i get high elo players going toxic ""a little bit"" but at least they get angry because they know some basics about the game. In low elo people just get mad at you because they play bad??? Like really weird.

Plus side, i have a steel mental right now lmao. I swear on everything, since i did this ""challenge"" or whatever, my OG account games or people there doesnt annoy me at all lol.

leagueoflegends,How am I supposed to climb/improve at this game I just don't get it,"I started playing league a lot in 2020, and mained jungle for a while, but switched to top in 2021 mid season. I find that every game I'm put in the same position, either freeze the wave and play passive and pray my team can win the game, or play agro and risk dying/getting ganked. Whenever I try to communicate with my jungler, in a nice way through pings and sometimes asking nicely in chat, they usually just fuck up the gank anyway and feed my lane. I don't know how I can work on improving myself if I need to rely on the rest of my team. If I don't play hyper aggressive and get fed early, all it takes is one laner to int and then I can't play or win the game anymore. I have tried different champs, and am playing more than 10 games a day on different accounts, and I can't even get out of bronze. I don't know what to do anymore, since I really want to improve at this game, but I just can't. I watch replays of my games and try and point out all the mistakes and then make sure not to make the same mistakes in future games, and again I find myself in the same place, with a frozen wave 0/0/0 in top lane unless the enemy messes up and I get a kill. I have 0 carry potential, and only feel like I can truly 1v9 from jungle, a role I do not enjoy playing nor do I enjoy the champs. I also cs around 7-8 per minute every game and always try and ping for objectives. I simply don't know what more I can do. Any ideas?",RitoShitCompany,19/03/23 04:02:09 PM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11vf6pz/how_am_i_supposed_to_climbimprove_at_this_game_i/
leagueoflegends,New mage item ideas,"Deathfire grasp:

NLR + Codex + Amp tomb + 615 = 3200 gold

120 ap, 20 ah

Unique active: Does 30-200 + 0.5ap magic damage to an opponent and then increases all magic damage from you by 15%.

Currently burst mages are struggling in late teamfights due to being unable to burst opponents. This item will address this as the premier burst legendary for mages. If opponents want to survive they must seriously invest into hp and mr instead of just a bt shield.

Binding scepter:

NLR + Codex + Amp tomb + 415 = 3000 gold

120 ap, 20 ah

Unique passive: Crowd control effects from you ignore 50% of the opponents tenacity.

Currently, there is so much tenacity in the game to the point where crowd control barely stops a diver or skirmisher from causing havoc. This item will be the solution for mages who want to take on a more peeling role in teamfights. Its high price point dissuades this item from being used by supports.",Dasdi96,14/03/23 11:17:08 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11qv37r/new_mage_item_ideas/

Between explaining the map (Lanes, jungle, river, turrets...), objectives (Dragon,  Herald, Baron, Turrets, Inhibitors...), how you win( nexus), champions ( how theres over 150+),  How and why different classes go to which lanes(tank-top, assasin/mage-mid...), and everything else, theres just so much.

leagueoflegends,"If I have a player in my team that spams FF and the team manages to win, that player should get reduced LP for this win","Everyone knows this situation right? You play a ranked game. The game might be looking dire, it might be even, in some cases you might even be ahead.

But then there is this one rat person. That one person which probably died once in lane, maybe twice or more and starts spamming FF as soon as minute 15 hits despite the game being perfectly winnable just because they miss the crucial skill of being able to let themselfes get carried.


Now everyone knows that League is highly reliant on momentum and I understand that sometimes, after your team got aced at an objective you feel like FF'ing and start that vote.
I dont want to argue for reduced gains after the first vote. I want to argue for reduced gains after the third vote started by one singular player.

With how much Riot has been trying to promote not being toxic I think its a step in the right direction.

Its a the mental tax you should have to pay for being a bitch ingame and only fair imo.",iamjackslastidea,13/03/23 04:42:30 PM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11q4aat/if_i_have_a_player_in_my_team_that_spams_ff_and/

leagueoflegends,Looking For League Players! (Beginners and Veterans),"Hi, I'm doing a design project for my university class, and my team is trying to design a product/service that enables beginners to deal with harassment in competitive team-based games such as League to promote a healthier community. As such, this process involves both beginners and veterans of the game. 

I'm hoping to at a base level, interview a player and have them play with a prototype design that we've come up with, which should take 30 minutes or so. Then, if possible, it'd be great if I could observe you play one game of League (or other competitive game of your choice) to learn more about the space. I understand that doing both might take too much time, but if you're interested in just doing the interview, that'd be great too! I need to have this done by Wednesday, so ideally Sunday, Monday, or Tuesday would be perfect if anyone could.

leagueoflegends,The Champion Personality Quiz (NEW &amp; IMPROVED),"What does your personality say about which Champion you should play?

This isn't your standard BuzzFeed quiz, we use real data and statistical techniques to ""map"" your answers and find the most similar Champions to your responses.

For the nerds, here's a detailed explanation of how it works: [https://www.itero.gg/articles/personality-quiz](https://www.itero.gg/articles/personality-quiz)

The tl:dr? When you answer a question like ""I prefer to seek out my kills alone"" with ""Totally Agree"", you'll be ""closer"" to those Champions which have a high percentage of solo kills in the data and therefore will be more likely to get them recommended. We repeat this for all 20 questions and find your overall ""closest"" champion!

Last year we introduced the very first version of the quiz: [https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/r817ba/a\_personality\_quiz\_to\_recommend\_champions\_for/](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/r817ba/a_personality_quiz_to_recommend_champions_for/)

Since then, we've made two major improvements:

1. Better techniques and a lot more data to provide reliable results (for instance, we now use data from lots of patches, not just the current one).
2. Massively improved the look of the website.

**THE QUIZ:** [https://www.itero.gg/personality-quiz](https://www.itero.gg/personality-quiz)

Why not if someone is banned for intentional feeding?,"I have played 2 separate games today where people on my team have actively ran it down so this is part vent, however this occurred to me when I got an instant feedback report for these players. I lost 26 lp for a game where multiple members of my team were walking down midlane and refusing to play. Why then, when we know that the game can detect it (as people do get banned for it) do we not have the same system as for afk players? I would argue the game is harder to win with someone inting than with someone leaving, so surely it is deserved for the players who have to suffer through it. And if technical difficulties in detecting it are the reason, then surely thats an issue that needs to be addressed anyway since the reports should be working? Sorry if this is too vent-y but in my opinion this is an oversight and a system like this would be very welcome.

leagueoflegends,[DISCUSSION] Why Can’t We See Dragons During Draft?,"It’s inarguable that League’s six elemental dragons are very powerful, but if you play often enough, you’ve probably run into more than a few games where they don’t *feel* powerful. You’ve probably attributed this feeling to a few dragons in particular; there’s a reason why Cloud Soul is derisively referred to as Clown Soul, and why no one gets excited to see Chemtech pop up on their screen, but make no mistake, all of League’s dragons *are* powerful, just, not in all situations — and especially not in all drafts.

While Infernal Dragon’s bonus Attack Damage and Ability Power can benefit just about every champion in the game, Chemtech Dragon’s bonus Heal and Shield Power only appeals to a few. Of course, there's nothing wrong with having a niche, but there *is* something wrong when it’s random.

There are broadly two types of randomness in game design: input randomness and output randomness, and both have different effects on how players feel.

The short of it is that input randomness feels good, while output randomness feels bad. The long of it is that input randomness rewards the player's knowledge, resource management, and or decision-making skills by giving them pieces of an unfinished puzzle, while output randomness dismisses the player's efforts by finishing the puzzle for them — sometimes incorrectly.

Input randomness is getting blue side or red side. The randomized information is decided by the game, handed to the player in draft, and then the player uses their skills to create an output through how they react. Output randomness is criting on a basic attack. The player makes a decision, and then the game creates a randomized output through its reaction. One is clearly less rewarding and creates a lot more frustration. In theory, elemental dragons are input randomness; in practice, they’re output randomness.

## How Are Elemental Dragons Output Randomness?

A good way of distinguishing output randomness from input randomness is by asking if a system is *creating* meaningful choices for the player or *reacting* to meaningful choices from the player. With the way that dragons work now, I don’t believe that they create *any* meaningful in-game choices.

I’d actually argue that the dragons don’t require any output from the player at all. Unlike Herald or Baron, dragons cannot be used or misused. Their effects are immediately active teamwide with no time limit. If dragons are input randomness, then they're missing the part where the player creates an output.

The elemental rifts also don’t create any output. While the changes to the map do bring players more opportunities, they do *not* bring players more choices. Opportunities are a land mass, but choices are a crossroads — they require sacrifice. The elemental rifts don't ask players to choose between A or B, they turn your A into an A+ and allow you to do B while you're at it. There isn’t anything wrong with increasing the players' opportunities, it's just that choices ask the player *how* they can do something, not *if* they can do something.

And no, choosing whether or not to get a dragon is not meaningful output. Firstly, it’s very noninteractive, as again, choices ask *hows,* not *ifs*, and Riot knows this; one of the main design purposes of objectives is to force teams to interact with one another, so it would be counterintuitive if not interacting with the dragon spawn was a viable win condition. Secondly, not interacting currently *isn’t* a viable win condition. Regardless of how powerful a specific dragon’s effects are for your team, the gold gain, and the ability to deny it from the enemy, means that the correct choice is always to grab as many as you can — this is a good thing. Thirdly, the only way that choosing between securing a dragon or not *could* become a meaningful choice is if securing a dragon could somehow be detrimental, which is unhealthy in its own way.

Dragons don’t create meaningful choices, but they certainly do react to them. Each dragon gives your team % stat increases, and unlike flat stat increases, this means champions who naturally build the buffed stat will benefit more from the dragon. If there’s anything dragon buffs interact with, it's your draft and not your gameplay decisions. But dragons are *random*, while your draft is not.

Simply putting one before the other solves this issue. You’ll no longer unwillingly draft assassins into Mountain Soul, or tanks into infernal. Instead, players will be able to create drafts unique to each dragon soul and combination — increasing draft variety in solo queue and especially in pro play.

I know Riot doesn’t want games to be decided in draft, and this on paper looks like it's giving drafts more power, but in reality, it would only reveal what power these drafts already have and put it directly into the player’s hands. If Riot truly doesn’t want dragons to impact the game this way, then they’ve done a bad job designing the buffs they give.

Of course, they *did* place the teamwide buff objective in a place that excludes a member of each team, but that's toplane’s problem.

## Commonly stated problems with revealing dragons during draft:

“If champions have a high win rate with one soul or rift, it will force Riot to balance champions around dragons.”

If champions have a high or low win rate with different souls or rifts, then *they already have a high or low win rate with different souls or rifts*. Regardless of whether or not Riot reveals that information to the player base, it exists, and closing your eyes doesn’t make it go away. If designers are worried about players taking advantage of the game they’ve designed, then they should look to fix their design instead of hiding it from their player base.

“This will limit draft diversity because people will always choose the best champions for each dragon.”

Assuming the player base has access to the champion win rates for each combination of dragons (there are like 100 odd combinations), or even just the win rates for each soul, why would this also mean that players have access to, the ability to, and the want to play all of these high win rate champions? There are high win rate champions in every patch, in every elo, on every server, and *none* are 100% p/b in solo queue, while in pro play, champion diversity is so stagnant that if pros somehow mastered just 6 of the 100 odd perfect drafts that this change would *apparently* create, it would be twice as many as they have now.

“People in solo queue don’t care about draft.”

Then at worst, it’s a non-issue, and at best the people who do care will climb faster.

“People will dodge when they see a soul that they don’t like.”

Yeah, that sucks. Those people suck. Those people are a vast minority.

\[QUESTION\] I’ve seen many people say that elemental dragons force players to adapt mid-match. The only adaptations I can think of are shallow or item-related, and because of that fall prey to the game's spotty item system. In what ways do elemental dragons actually make players adapt? Are these ways fun, interesting, or engaging?",Responsibility-Mean,14/03/23 06:38:22 PM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11r2q7s/discussion_why_cant_we_see_dragons_during_draft/

leagueoflegends,LEC staff could fully prepare some engaging segments in case of unfortunate delays.,"I love LEC but recently the delays has been getting out of hand. Given the analyst and casters desk are not at fault, but sometime even they struggle to fill in the time. And while they cannot do anything technically to remove or shorten the delays, they can surely be prepared just in case the next delay is right around the corner. Perhaps a proper small stage set up for the quiz show (not like hey ive got some question can you answer this, but a genuine stage like who wants to be a millionaire)  or host 1 v 1 between staff or involving the fans or guess the elo alongside fans. Heck even call LS or Dom who would be live viewing the game. Anything engaging that has been pre planned rather than coming up with something to do on spot. 

Of course it would be nice just not to have delays but i am not very optimistic about it being resolved. Just my two cents.",gintokisamadono,13/03/23 11:31:32 PM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11qctsz/lec_staff_could_fully_prepare_some_engaging/

leagueoflegends,They should make Skarner more like a scorpion.," 

**1.  Scorpions don't typically pursue their prey, they wait for it to come to them.**  
Because of this, we should remove the spire passive and replace it with one that gives Skarner an advantage for setting up in a bush.  Perhaps the bush itself becomes the ""spire"" and gives some kind of an indication that is only visible to his allies that he is at an advantage in/near that particular bush.

Scorpions are covered with tiny hairs that they use to become extra sensitive to their surroundings when they prepare ambushes...  Maybe give him a vision boost when the passive is active?  Maybe give the enhanced bush block vision similarly to a control ward?

**2.  They don't typically use their stinger to apprehend prey... they use their pincers.**

His Q should have the bonus damage removed and slow instead.  

**3.  Scorpions are fast as f\*\*\***  
Scorpions can move up to 12 miles an hour, which is quite fast for their size.  If you were to scale them up to the size of a human, they'd be capable of running about 65-70 MPH...  So our big boy should be zooming, right?

I recommend removing his E entirely and replacing it with a toggleable speed boost.  Make it drain mana slowly and give him the whole crystal-empowered look.

His W is great as is, but since we're moving the movement steroid to his E it can be removed from the W.

**4.  Scorpions use their sting only when they need to and because the venom/toxin is quite expensive to produce from a biological perspective, they use it conservatively.**

Therefore, it makes sense for it to be his ultimate.

Many types of scorpions use it to incapacitate their prey.  

Personally, I think it would be most fitting for the ultimate to be some kind of single-target long duration stun that allowed Skarner to latch to them with Q and carry them away.  The tether has always seemed sort of wonky to me.

If they decide to go the AOE impale route as shown in the update, they should at least rotate the hitbox so that it comes to a point at its furthest range.

**5.  Some scorpions can live for up to a year without eating**

However, whenever I see Skarner players they are feeding multiple times in just a couple of minutes.  What gives?

In conclusion, I think that Skarner could be improved by just making him more like a scorpion.",DancingCow,18/03/23 05:31:44 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11u4h2n/they_should_make_skarner_more_like_a_scorpion/

leagueoflegends,Skin ideas for every champ - R,"Hello everyone!

Continuing the series as usual, today we have R.

**Xayah &amp; Rakan**

*Justicar*: So right off the bat I have to make an exception and bring a champ forward from their later post, who is Xayah. Since they are a couple and have duo skins, this seemed like the most logical solution. With Justicar they would have a more angelic look with, well, angel wings.

*Debonair*: Surely a fabulous duo, no doubt they'd slay in this.

*Dragon Lovers*: Dragon wings, feet, Xayah shooting scales.

*Solar &amp; Lunar Eclipse*: Normally I'd probably give Solar to Rakan and Lunar to Xayah, but since these two skins are already somewhat similar to their existing cosmic skins, maybe switching up the themes with this one would make it feel a little more different.

*Dawn &amp; Nightbringer*: Similar idea, a yin and yang duo skin. Could add a little Romeo and Juliet vibe to the story since these two are opposing sides, but maybe their love could end the fight. Or not, just a thought.

*Heartthrobs &amp; Heartaches*: Since I saw these skins, I treat them as couple skins, and who would be more fitting to this idea, than Xayah and Rakan. Xayah the shy, introverted little bit emo girl, while Rakan the charmer who is chased by every girl in school, but still whos heart is all hers. Classic story.

**Rammus**

*Arcade*: Looks like Bowser, rolls like Sonic, a video game themed skin sounds ok to me.

*Battlecast*: I know he has full metal, but he could still fit into this imo.

*Definitely Not Rammus*: Just for the lolz.

*Death Blossom*: Combine DB Kha'zix with GotS Rammus. At least that's how I thought of it.

*Prehistoric*: Ankylosaurus vibes.

*Racer*: A toy skin where he can transform into a wheel? Something like that idk.

**Rek'sai**

*Queen Bee*: Matches her character I believe.

*Deep Sea*: As the name suggests, some kind of scary deep sea fish, maybe something like an anglerfish. Splash similar to Nami's.

*Kaiju*: I mean she kinda looks like one, she just needs to be reeeeealy big.

**Rell**

*Ashen Charger*: Morde has a skin in this universe and since she was 'made' to defeat him I thought she should have a skin like this too. With all the armor it's fitting anyways I reckon.

*Marauder*: Similarly, the armor inspired.

*High Noon*: She has a horse.

*Strike Cavalier*: Steel Valkyries skin, just found it fitting, because of all the metal you can easily make this work.

*Medieval*: Like Sir Kled.

**Renata Glasc**

*Captain*: She could easily be the captain of an evil pirate ship, for sure.

*High Noon*: She also has the vibes for this. I imagine a similar splash to that of Senna. Sry, couldn't come up with more for her. :/ Thought of things like Dreadnova or Crime City, but Dreadnova would just be way too similar to Admiral and CC is already a lot like her base look.

**Renekton**

*Praetorian*: A terminator machine programmed to nothing but killing. I find it perfect for Rene.

*Odyssey: Space crocodile.*

*Atlantean*: Some fitting armor, couple of scales and fins here and there. Has some potential I think.

*Worldbreaker*: He has enough anger to tear the world apart.

**Rengar**

*Infernal*: Imagine if his mane was flaming ooo.

*Tribal/Beast Hunter*: I'd make him look like an actual lion and give some simple jungle tribe clothing. Leaves, bones etc. Like he was actually from Ixtal you know.

*Snow Moon*: As I usually say, BM mostly works on assassins, but thought, why not give it a little twist and choose Snow Moon instead and then make him into a snow leopard.

**Riven**

*Battle Queen*: It's just fitting.

*Dragonslayer*: She got a big sword, why not.

*Executioner*: Why not make a female executioner, her weapon kinda matches that too.

*Ashen Warrior*: Idk it just works. Could give her those purple wings when she activates ult.

*Blood Moon*: She's not an assassin, but close enough so BM matches her too.

*Pool Party/Ocean Song*: Her sword is a popsicle. First I thought of a broken surf board, but wasn't sure how she would hold that in one hand.

**Rumble**

*Rumblebee*: A bee skin. Although Bumblebee is also in Transformers, idk what to do with that information.

*Dragon Trainer*: Other yordles have DT skins so that's one reason, and two, you could make his mech into something similar to the Blitz &amp; Crank skin and Rumble would control the mech and the dragon would sit in the fist and he'd be the flamethrower esentially.

*Mecha Kingdoms*: He has a mech, so ye.

*Astronaut/Alien Invader*: Spaceship or UFO.

*Toy*: His mech could easily work as a toy too.

**Ryze**

*Elderwood*: An old elf mage, tree trunk on back, leaves for beard as Bard has it.

*Dark Star*: I imagine his spells could look really nice especially the ultimate that'd esentially become a collapsing black hole.

*Wisdom Dragon*: Cool dragon tattoos, cool elemental vfx.

*Infernal*: Cool fire vfx.

*Empyrean*: Cool RGB vfx. Plus imagine his body being all black and his tattoos glowing. Sick, right?

*Santa*: Full santa outfit, make his beard white, the scroll is the list of the kids or the bag or presents.

leagueoflegends,This game becomes more and more one-sided in High elo,"Riot adds durability patch so everybody becomes more tanky, but then shifts power back into more potential gold gain for only the team that wins early (platings). Find the error.  


I have to give old league credit where credit is due. it was amazingly designed for not allowing slightly better players every game to giga gap by 2k gold dif their opponents when winning lanes. You had to be insanely clean, you had to get alot of cs while still cleanly killing ur enemys, you had to do perfect recalls and while that takes much more effort than the average winning player on lane today, they still got much less of a gold lead.  
Nowadays 1 kill is enough to take 1-2 extra plates into a recall which already gives you a 650G lead on ur enemy laner. the entire midgame is flawed because ur so ahead when it starts in terms of gold, that you simply don't need to sidelane/splitpush and get high cs because all you have to do is killing ur enemys with a aram midlane playstyle over and over and snowball even more. The team that is behind feels absolutely miserable while all of this is happening because their only counterplay is hoping that you fuck up. (the player that does well on the team that is behind also feels extremely miserable because he doesn't want to teamfight with his teammates who are behind, yet it feels like for him going to sidelane and pushing waves gives him little to no reward)  


In old league, the guy that went to the sidelane and powerfarmed creeps went ahead in gold and level (which were huge powerspykes back then but are alot less) if the other team is afking aram fighting permamently and doesn't clean sweep the fight.  
Also you can gain so much gold today from killing/objectives/towers, that minion gold becomes less and less valuable in comparison. it just takes way to long to get an actual good amount of gold lead from purely minions, meaning once again ur insanely dependet on either killing or taking towers. But when ur in a team that is behind guess what, ur not gonna kill really anybody, and not rly take alot of towers, at least much less than what the enemy team does, so u JUST FEEL BAD and it IS BAD  
this is why high elo games nowadays feel and look insanely stupid. there is no thoughts behind it, it's just braindead pointless fights over and over, hoping that 1 side wins 3 of them in a row into a total stomp with zero counterplay right after.  


Oh ps: i also dislike that minions don't push back when i push out a sidelane, like they did in the past. Legit annoying. In the past if nobody moved to the sidelane, minions stacked up of 3 waves came back with 20+ minions towards you and the game basically rewarded you and punished the enemys who didn't bother to pick up the minions on the sidelane. Nowdays Minions kill each other and freeze on any point they colide in the Lane, no matter if u pushed or not. it takes minutes to create a slowpush by minions on their own. the game in the past was never like this, and it enforced macroplay being a much bigger Deal than todays league is. there is a good and BIG reason why splitpush champions that bloomed in 1v1 back in the day don't function properly anymore except they are overbuffed and hardcounter current meta champs",FoxGoesBOOM,17/03/23 06:23:41 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11t89uo/this_game_becomes_more_and_more_onesided_in_high/

leagueoflegends,"Clash still has the problem of losing the first game and having your next opponent forfeit, but I have the perfect solution !","Mathematically, half of clash teams lose their first game, but (I feel like) most loser bracket never happen because of a high dropout rate.

To summary, the  winner bracket is lot of fun, the loser bracket is usually an unfun waiting room.

Lots of solution has been suggested, but here is mine :

* Remove loser bracket
* Teams who lose can retry and look for another bracket if it's still in the allowed time frame.
* A team who won a bracket can not retry and has to stop for the day.
* The clash reward is based on your best performance of the day.

&amp;#x200B;

Why is this the best solution for players :

* No more forfeit. As only the winner bracket remain, every team has the incentive to play and win. Unless something happen IRL for one of the player, forfeit should not happen anymore.
* No more waiting time after a loss. You lost your first game ? No problem, you can retry a new bracket with close to no waiting time.
* Groups of friend that booked their evening to play clash together will be able to play many games, even if they lose every single one of them.
* More teams will look for a bracket, meaning less waiting time in the matchmaking
* As smurfers will get to play only once per account (as they probably will stomp and win), the average number of smurf teams per bracket will decrease.  


&amp;#x200B;

Why is this the best solution for Riot games :

* No amount of reward will completely fix loser bracket, because a part of players play to win and be #1, and another has bad mental and ragequit after first loss. Both case are solved if we remove loser bracket.
* The amount of clash games played will increase.
* Players still get the possibility to be #1 even if they lose their first game.
* It does require very little work to be implemented.

&amp;#x200B;

To be honest, I see only one downside : I'm not sure that EUW server will be able to handle the overall increase in clash games.

leagueoflegends,Durability update was a failure,"Last season, champions were given more health, armor, magic resist and scalings to combat the over-increasing damage present in the game. This was a proposed solution to balance out the state of the game filled with the all so prevalent assassins, high base damage on tanks, high damage from mythic items and increasing the longevity of ADCs and Mages survival. While it provided much relief at first, patches later we're right back to square one. 


The patches after the durability update started slowly increasing and tweaking damage values due to a degree of nerfing some champions that were still doing too much damage or just continuously buffing champions over and over (when they weren't a problem in the first place).


Then we're here today. There is still TOO much damage in this game.

leagueoflegends,Skin ideas for every champ - T,"Hello everyone!

Back to work, today is T.

Here we go.

**Tahm Kench**

*Dog*: Couldn't come up with a good pun name, but I think it'd be funny nevertheless. A big doggo using their tounge as a weapon. Think of Odie eg.

*Crime City Nightmare*: I wanna see him in those striped suits, just fits him so well.

*Dark Star*: Kinda like Arcana, but with black and purple. Could put a black hole in his stomach.

*Lunar Guardian*: The usual Kha'zix and Malphite vibes. They are just super nicely executed and great examples of what a good monster skin should look like. Mostly talking about the splash arts here.

*Mecha*: To have a robotic skin.

*Dragon*: A little fat dragon with a burning tongue.

*Frog Prince*: He already looks kinda like a frog, but he also is dressed like a gentleman so this funny idea came to my mind. Make him look even more like a frog while also dressing him up as a prince.

**Taliyah**

*Academy*: She also has the schoolgirl vibes like Sera, she could be a student in Swain's magic school from yesterday's post.

*Bloodstone*: A more evil version of Taliyah is already interesting imo, but replacing her normal stones with the bloodstones is really what I thought of this for.

*Elderwood*: Earth based elemental bending is something not entirely far from Elderwood I believe.

*Dark Star*: An other dark themed skin, but this time we use rocks floating in space and eg. her Q could turn them into meteorites.

*Obsidian/Volcanic/Infernal*: Molten lava and volcanic rocks.

**Talon**

*Shockblade*: He's an assassin like the rest of the skin line and that already makes him a good fit.

*Death Sworn*: I find him a perfectly good fit here as well. Kata and Zed have a skin here too, so it makes some sense.

*Dragonslayer/Beast Hunter*: I know he is more personalised and kills...humans, but that doesn't mean he can't perform well with bigger targets.

*Omen of the Dark*: Kinda like Nocturne with a face and legs.

*Sandstorm*: Kata has a skin like this, will fit Talon just the same if not better. Actually, since he already has a hood and a cape, turning those into scarves will make even more sense.

*Headhunter*: He's an assassin, sure.

*Project/PsyOps*: Both are good and work for him.

**Taric**

*Freljord*: Regional outfit, and the gems might just be ice.

*Broken Covenant*: You could do some stuff with the gems being stained glass pieces.

*Three Honors*: Idk just felt like the visuals might work on him, maybe not.

Porcelain: Definitely a good fit for him. This is probably the one that offers the best material options for the gems.

*Faerie Court*: Basically just recolour Emerald and add a couple of butterflies and flowers here and there.

**Teemo**

*Dark Star*: Ah yes, we have arrived to the one and only Teemo. I find DS a really nice fit, because one, it brings forward his dark demonic self like LD, and two, black holes work perfectly for shrooms. I would also put Astronaut Teemo somewhere at the back of the splash art for a funny cameo.

*Sugar Rush*: Could put cakes or cupcakes for the traps - if Caitlyn allows the latter.

*Pool Party*: The traps could be water balloons that splash out if someone steps on them.

*Trick-or-Treat*: Some funny costume and the good old jack-o'-lanterns for his R.

**Thresh**

*Arcana*: Not sure, just felt like it has potential.

*Elderwood*: Roots, vines, flowers, leaves, lots of elements can be used here.

*Pharaoh*: Again, can't really explain it, it just works.

*Fright Night*: He has a really good base for this, just gotta make him even scarier.

*Pool Party*: A lifeguard like Taric, his W throws a life-belt, his Q something like a net maybe.

**Tristana**

*High Noon*: Basically a yordle version of Senna.

*Odyssey*: Space yordle with a laser cannon.

**Trundle**

*Old God*: An ancient forest troll spirit. Could use a whole tree for the club.

*Marauder*: Armored Trundle. Along the lines of Ali, Olaf and WW.

*Lunar Guardian*: Something very similar to Malph.

*Mecha*: Robot troll.

*Prehistoric*: Keep the club, just not from ice and add a general caveman outfit on him. His movement and all just fit this well.

*Greatclub*: DnD/Rift Quest skin. He's a troll, self-explanatory.

*Pool Party*: A giant pool noodle, his W creates a pool area and his E erects a beach umbrella maybe?

**Tryndamere**

*Immortal Dragon*: A dragonmancer skin. He has lots of free skin space for cool dragon tattoos and his spin could have a dragon around it.

*Pharaoh*: He has many skins that depict him as a leader, like a king, sultan etc. so making him a pharaoh follows this.

*Mecha Kingdoms*: A techy, robotic skin.

*Spirit Blossom*: I think it works, I mean if Darius can have one, he surely can too.

*Ruined*: Definitely way more interesting than corrupting someone like Draven...

**Twisted Fate**

*Arcana*: Just make him use tarot cards, it's so obvious.

*Arcanist*: He's already close to this, just give him a slightly more wizard-like look.

*Omen of the Dark*: Full on plague doctor.

*Ssssmokin'*: Honestly idk what way to go with this concept, I just thought he could have a skin where he's dressed up similarly to the Mask. If you change his clothes to yellow and put a feather in his hat that's alredy almost that. He could even throw money instead of cards.

**Twitch**

*Dreadnova/Odyssey*: A space skin for Twitch.

*Firecracker*: Shooting fireworks with auto attacks, as it is with all of these skins.

*Praetorian*: I can see this work, a terminator robot, he can go invisible which works with that and he shoots laser from his gun.

*Surprise Party*: Him suddenly appearing out of nowhere and shooting your team to death really fits this fantasy. Plus his voice lines are also funny.

My power disconnected. I watched the replay and I d/c'd at 32:22 and game ends at 35:46. That's about a 3min interval between me d/cing and the game ending. You can't use a 1:30 afk penalty in a 30minute game. The concept between that and a pre 15 game is insane. The state of the game was beyond established and literal minutes away from winning and I just straight up end up losing LP after playing for 32 straight minutes and missing 3 minutes of a game?

There has to be a better algorithm we can use for afk fringe cases. It's unfair to players putting their all into a game, d/cing at an ending or halfway point, coming back and losing LP. The stats I have alone are worth more than a thousand words. Literally, middle of the pack cspm showing how active I was in the game, practically involved in half the k/p of the team and topped the damage charts. 

What more indicative stats is needed to not get penalized for random power/internet outages and what time frame can be used after 15/20mins for a player to be able to come back to a game without being punished?

leagueoflegends,I think people are misunderstanding the point of the Yuumi rework and I do personally think it's a massive improvement in terms of design and game health,"Ever since the Yuumi dropped people have been scratching their heads and foaming at the mouth on why this champion stays untargetable and why her new passive encourages her to stay attached and insist that it solves nothing.

To put it bluntly, I beg to differ. The new Yuumi is *huge* improvement on all fronts in terms of making her just as accessible while limiting the edge cases that made her a pain in the ass to deal with untargetability be damned. Riot was never  gonna remove or add any caveat to her indefinite attachment because that's literally the point of the champ.

The issue with the old Yuumi was that she basically turned her lane partner into a living sandbag for enemy skillshots and only kept them alive to buy time for either them to scale or ditch them entirely for a bruiser or an assassin that got ahead so they could 2v8. With the best friend mechanic, she's forced to bet on her adc in order to have a proper impact on the game, which means she can't just abandon them first chance she gets and expect to have the same impact as she would normally.

&amp;#x200B;

In addition, her abilities have a lot more straightforward counterplay than they did before especially since they only really shine on one ally.  Instead of mashing E and giving her anchor free stats, Her healing swapped to her passive which means that she has actually has hit her Q or aa in order to sustain her carry properly in the lane phase. Her Q is now a more conventional skillshot so dodging it is more feasible, and her E being a shield makes it easier to deal with since timing it matters a lot more. The R lost its root in favor of a stacking slow so now she doesn't just give anybody hard cc or engage.

&amp;#x200B;

All that being said, currently she is definitely way too strong. Particularly in her mana problems being non-existent even early in the game and her having way too many tools to make bursting her carry a fool's errand.  These are things that can be more fine tuned with furhter updates which riot is already looking into. Another worry I have is a potential loophole or exploit with the best friend mechanic that leads to the same degeneracy we were trying to do away with.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR As it stands now, I think conceptually Yuumi is waaaay better than she was in the past. There are still some sore spots but it isn't anything unfixable. I do think players don't have much incentive to be active on her which is a problem I think riot does need to solve especially if you intend Yuumi to actually get her carry out of the lane phase. I also think her Q poke and anti burst on ultimate are currently out of line. If Yuumi and her carry got caught out with CC imo they should die right there. I legit think she's one or two nerfs away from being just fine as a champ.",EdenReborn,14/03/23 01:54:06 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11qghc0/i_think_people_are_misunderstanding_the_point_of/
leagueoflegends,How can AP Varus be any healthy for the game?,"This champion when built AP is pretty much unstoppable if you try to kill him 1 on 1. 

His only weakness becomes the fact that he is pretty much immobile but other than that he literally autos you two times and then Q's you and you are just dead? How is that even remotely to being fair to play against? 

A champion to which as soon as you get into his auto range you are instantly dead to his W+Q combo isn't healthy, and even than that he can even long range pick you with R then finish you with Q as well.

And lastly, not only he can oneshot squishies, but he can oneshot tanks as well. Is this really what you get for being immobile? Being able to oneshot someone as soon as he gets in your AA range?

The only counterplay becomes to get a champion that can one shot him before he can but that shouldn't be a champion's only counterplay. He may not be in the best state right now but surely the build isn't healthy to play against.",FabioSxO,19/03/23 04:02:20 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11uysi1/how_can_ap_varus_be_any_healthy_for_the_game/

Skarner’s Spires are leaving his kit, but this opens up the opportunity for a Support to have something similar. This support would be create towers across the map throughout the game that buffs allies in a certain way for a limited time. It would promote team fights as well, which I know Riot LOVES. 

Now this is just a concept, I’m not saying THESE stats are like a lock-down… were just a “hmmm this makes sense” kinda thing. 

The support would probably be most balanced by having to earn a passive currency (similar to Syndra or Sona). This requires them to actually do well in lane. What this means, with this currency passive to create these towers, the rest of his kit needs to be mechanically difficult. You are offering HUGE bonuses to your allies so to balance this out, the champion needs a complex kit and high skill ceiling.

Just a thought, keeping the mechanic of Skarner’s kit in the game.",Exorcinned,18/03/23 09:13:20 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11uab7s/skarners_spires_new_support_passive/
leagueoflegends,What are the chances RNG actually miss playoffs?,"Everyone always knows RNG as one of the strongest LPL teams, but this year they’ve been looking pretty shaky, even though the only position they changed from their MSI teams was midlane. Now they’re tied for the last spot left in playoffs with IG and WE, and there’s a chance they might not make it.

It seems though their last two series are against somewhat weaker teams (NIP and RA), but given the volatility of LPL so far this year, it wouldn’t be absolutely shocking if they lost one of those series. What are the odds you think that they get edged out?

And if they do, would that be one of the most shocking playoff misses in league history?",tassadar271,17/03/23 10:21:35 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11tedj6/what_are_the_chances_rng_actually_miss_playoffs/

Iron-bronze 1 trophie
Bronze-Silver 1 trophie
Silver-Gold 2 trophies
Gold- platinum 3 trophies
Platinum -diamond 4 trophies
Diamond-master 5 trophies
Master-grandmaster 7 trophies
Grandmaster-challenger 10 trophies

Trophie cost would change depending on how old the skin is

leagueoflegends,Long ARAM games are unfun and need to be fixed,"Riot made all these changes to try balance ARAMs out and make them faster and more enjoyable, but with roll backs and other changes I'm seeing now more than ever ARAMs where people just sit under turrets and refuse to fight for 30+ minutes. I've played multiple ARAMs in the last 3 days that have gone for over 30 minutes with less than 30 kills total, has the LCK invaded ARAMs?

There needs to be some incentive for fighting and actually playing to the spirit of the mode, if people wanted to sit around and throw abilities at minions for 30 minutes they'd go play summoners rift. ARAMs should never reach a point where they're typically the same game length as norms but here we are, something needs to be done about it, stalling has become far too easy and boring of a tactic.

What I really like about old ASOL was his unique gameplay and you really need to understand how to play him and how get to a certain position in the team fights now the new ASOL feels like dumb dumb dragon that no need for mastery you just abuse your skill 1, that's the main thing I hate about his new kit being a basic skill of Vel's ultimate where you can move while using it with the skill 2.

leagueoflegends,Infecting terrain or camps Champion Idea,"So I was hoping Bel'veth would be like this, as they really showed her ""taking over"" and ""summoning things"" but she was NOT what I expected. What if there was a champion that wasn't too strong in 1v1's but was an insane macro champion. Maybe they could like infect monsters to then release them to go into waves sorta like mini minion c4's. Or maybe they could alter the jungle's terrain directly? Essentially what if the gameplay loop of the champion revolves around taking over terrain to get more powerful and they unlock or evolve certain abilities based on how much of the map is terraformed to their liking? I would love them to be a mainly macro focused champion but you know, still has to set up, so they could always be stopped from applying pressure to lanes (and if their power is based on terraforming land then invades would help counter them). It's just an idea so not really thought out but I love the idea of making the gameplay loop around infecting terrain or monsters. Closest people I could think of was ivern and skarner but they don't really expand on this fantasy very well.

leagueoflegends,Pro Players ratings as FIFA Ultimate Team Cards,"Hi :) I made FUT cards for some pro players after rating them. Obviously I couldn't use football stats for League pros, but I did my best to come up with something that made at least a bit of sense. The ratings are based on the players' stats and performances I was able to watch live or some VODs, take them with a grain of salt, as I made this for fun, rather than precision. Feel free to discuss tho.   


Regarding the stats, I had to come up with a system that fits League. Again, I'm no pro player or challenger elo coach, so I came up with the following:

**Mechanics (MEC):** A player's raw mechanical skill. How likely this player is to press the right buttons at the right time, to land skillshots, efficiently use their champion's kit and outplay their opponents.

**Aggresion (AGG)**: A player's aggresive instinct. It measures how likely this player is to push forward, pressure their enemies, engage and fight, looking for advantages such as CS difference, kill pressure, kills, gold difference, etc.

**Vision (VIS):** Vision score, basically. This tries to measure a player's ability to control vision in the map, whether by placing wards or tracking enemy movement. Supports and Junglers usually show higher numbers in vision in comparison to the rest of the roles.

**Mental (MNT):** Mental measures a player's capability to keep calm, stay cool and not letting the pressure get to them. Higher the mental stat, higher is the player's likelihood to perform well despite being 4-man ganked twice in a row in a Game 5 in Worlds Finals. 

**Positioning (POS):** Positioning refers to a player's capability to be properly placed in fights in relation to their role, but it also refers to a player's understanding of his movement in the map. Players who get first blood, high kill participation while keeping themselves safe are examples of good positioning. Being at the right place at the right time.  


*Why is positioning separated from mechanics?* Well, for the purpose of this post (and cards) good Positioning can make you evade ganks, but good Mechanics can make you turn a gank into a 1v2 double kill. For example, TheShy might be the most incredible case of a player employing his mechanical skill to fight his way out of every situation his bad positioning put him in. 

**Versatility (VRS):** This measures a player's capability to adapt to different gameplans and champions. A player who succeeds at playing different champions and roles will receive a high VRS rating. For example, Caps may be one of the most versatile players in the past years, as he has played a high amount of unique champions and performed well, also he has played Mid and ADC,so there's that.

EXAMPLE:

[2016 TSM Doublelift](https://preview.redd.it/25t4l7uniyna1.png?width=300&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=8388387bd02cd39fea3ac34cd2f610c337f9e466)

Every role benefits from different stats. For example, ADC's benefit more from their MEC and POS ratings and less from their VIS rating. Top benefits highly from MNT. Support benefits from high VIS, and MEC has low value for the support role.  
Jungle and Mid are the most well-rounded roles. 

I know these stats and parameters are far from perfect, but again, this is for fun, so don't take it too seriously.

I tried to include as many players from different regions as I could (or my memory allowed to).

Some of the card types are chosen to fit players with a theme such as ""Future Stars"" (Exakick 2023), ""Players to watch"" (Karsa 2015), ""Rulebreakers"" (Caps 2019), ""Team of the Year"" (World Champions), History Makers (Faker 2015) and so on.

leagueoflegends,Hardstuck in Bronze: How to carry and climb as a Support?,"&amp;#x200B;

Honest question.

I see many posts about people being hardstuck in low elo and them feeling that's undeserved. I'm in Bronze myself and mostly get teamed up with Iron / Bronze players.

The advice those people get is most of the times in line with 'don't focus on your team mates, focus on improving your own skills'.

That sounds fair to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**Support**

However, I would like to have some specific advice for this for people like me who play Support.

Can Supports 'carry' or 'make or break' a game? How can I bring my skills as a Support player to a sufficient level to actually climb?

&amp;#x200B;

**Examples**

I know this might sound like flaming but I want to share what seriously happened in my last three games:

&amp;#x200B;

* Midlaner was 0/4 at 5 minutes, decided to leave the game and came back after 10 minutes to literally intentionally feed the enemy (game lost)

&amp;#x200B;

* Jungler kept jumping in between groups of enemies and was 0/2 before the 3 minutes mark; kept feeding them (game lost)

&amp;#x200B;

* Jungler and midlaner where respectively 0/8 and 0/7 (while Top and ADC were playing well but didn't have as many kills) (game lost)

&amp;#x200B;

For me, this show the complexity of being a Support player. 'Cause ones the other lanes are fed, it becomes incredibly hard to do something against an enemy team.

&amp;#x200B;

And yes, this also happens in the other team.

&amp;#x200B;

My question remains though: what do I need to do as a Support player in those situations to increase the chance of actually winning the game?

&amp;#x200B;

Or should I learn another role to climb?",SingSongSangSungSeng,17/03/23 07:34:28 PM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11toj4n/hardstuck_in_bronze_how_to_carry_and_climb_as_a/

leagueoflegends,Suggestion: Ultimate incoming ping.," I just get this idea, I don't know if you think, but I think it can be useful for the matches.

But  my idea is let you ping ""ultimate incoming"", an ideal shotcall for global area (or almost global) champs like Ashe, Ezreal, Jinx, Nocturne, Twisted Fate, etc.

What's are your opinion about this? It must to be implemented in the game? I know there is an ""incoming"" call out, but the teammates doesn't get it, so maybe this can be more clear for teamwork.",cuchix,14/03/23 03:09:30 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11qihmx/suggestion_ultimate_incoming_ping/

On football (or soccer for u guys that live in USA) a team play lots of tournaments per year, and they are considered a dynasty if they can win one or both national Championships for like, 5 years in a row, or win 2+ continental championships in 4 years or less.

What about in League? Teams play 2 national championships and potentially 2 world championships per year. What is the minimum requisitos for you to consider a team a dynasty for his region?

leagueoflegends,Serrated Dirk should probably be 1200g,"Dirk on introduction was an 1100g item that originally gave 25 AD and 10 lethality, and honestly, it was perfectly fine. Riot must've thought assassins needed some help because they eventually buffed it to 30 AD, and that's when we started seeing issues. 5 AD may not sound like a lot, but that's about 175g worth of stats, and more importantly, since it's an item that's usually bought first, you're getting that 175g of extra efficiency on your first back when it's the most impactful. 

Having Dirk in this overtuned state resulted in a lot of very unfortunate balance issues that have continued into seasons 12 and 13. Assassins like Zed were top tier for months at a time. Zed and most other AD assassins were nerfed, but now we have the issue of an entire class being balanced around an overtuned item instead of the item being balanced for the class which is a significantly better balance philosophy in the long term. And that actually leads me to my next point: bruisers abusing lethality items because serrated dirk is so efficient and easy to snowball off of. Champions like Aatrox, Hecarim, Kled, and Yorick who are healthiest when building bruiser and tank items were and in some cases still are getting away with building essentially full damage because they can so consistently snowball off an early dirk. Aatrox and Yorick were nerfed in such a way to make their lethality builds less viable, but again Riot is nerfing the champions around the item, effectively sidestepping the core issue that dirk is overtuned, and in doing so they're allowing it to continue to cause more problems. 

Granted, all of this isn't 100% because of dirk. Eclipse itself is a problematic item design because it just  does too much. It has a ton of damage, gives both lethality and % penetration, and gives a shield and ms. It's loaded up with all these premier stats that all sorts of champions would love to get their hands on so it's not surprising that many of them can abuse it. If you were to give Eclipse and Duskblade the exact same amount of stats and passives in terms of gold efficiency, Eclipse would outperform almost every single time. Even so, nerfing dirk to 1200g is the first step in permanently solving all these problems. Delaying that power spike by an extra wave is huge in terms of shortening the window these champs have to snowball.",bburgers9,15/03/23 09:41:36 PM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11rwriy/serrated_dirk_should_probably_be_1200g/
leagueoflegends,Increase ARAM dodge penalty (by a lot),"Right now, the penalty is 15 minutes for the first dodge, 30 minutes for the second, and 720 minutes for the third. On top of that, the player who dodges loses any rerolls they used in that lobby.

Now here's the thing. If you queue up as a premade group, you're likely to play against another group occasionally. And premades dodge the fuck out of this mode. The increased queue time is unnecessary as well. I got to wait longer for a game so my opponents have a better chance at shitting on me. That's cool man.


I'm sure Riot doesn't want to increase the time penalty to something that actually hurts (e.g. 24 hours) so target the rerolls instead:

Make the player who dodges lose all his rerolls, no matter if they used them or did not. Make the dodger lose the ability to acquire new rerolls in their next two games.

**Make all of their premades also lose their rerolls, no matter if they used them or not. There, problem fixed.**

If you're in a lobby and your friend has a legitimate emergency in the 60 seconds between ready check and the end of the draft, well shit happens you just lost a reroll or two, you'll get over it.",DoorHingesKill,16/03/23 08:28:54 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11sejrx/increase_aram_dodge_penalty_by_a_lot/

leagueoflegends,Faerie Court Duck ft. Ezreal,"Even though I'm in camp ""Ezreal needs more serious skins instead of femboy skins"", I really like what the artists did with his splash art for the Faerie Court skin.  
As an aspiring artist myself I knew I had to at least try and draw some fanart but the problem was there was already so many great fanarts.

So to differentiate myself from all the other ones I decided to add a duck (cause ducks are great) but it quickly became the main character and now Ezreal is just a side character in its adventures.

leagueoflegends,Here’s how to trade League of Legends stocks - free predictions game,"\*\*Disclaimer for mods - this site has ZERO real money betting nor affiliation with gambling sites.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR**: Two examples: (1) [G2 Esports Stock](https://manifold.markets/EsportsStocks/g2-esports-lol-stock-f95441ddb09e) (2) [Will Faker leave T1?](https://manifold.markets/ManifoldMarkets/will-faker-play-on-a-team-other-tha)

Buy YES shares of your favourite teams and NO shares of your rivals! Or, create and trade on predictions about other events.

&amp;#x200B;

There’s a free, play-money prediction marketplace called [Manifold Markets](https://manifold.markets/home). It allows users to create markets about any question or thing they wish and trade on it with others. Many analysts claim they are super knowledgeable about the game, imagine them being able to prove it and compete against the community to earn play money profit. If a viewer of a streamer ever disagrees with their take, they can create a market on it and the two sides can bet against each other.

After thinking about how best to use these markets for League of Legends esports, I’ve settled on the following structure:

* Stocks for each team competing in a tier 1 division.
* Users can buy either YES or NO shares depending on how good they think the team is
* The site operates using an odds system a bit similar to sports betting that changes how profitable buying YES or NO is based on the market’s probability. Because of this, I’ve decided that the markets should be able to resolve fully to YES or NO and pay long-term holders under specific conditions (see description on Manifold for specifics). However, it is expected that the majority of users will make a profit by actively trading the stocks.

You can also create your own markets and add them to the League of Legends group! In addition to the Stocks markets, I’ve also made some to predict certain events about my favourite players.You can find all the markets here: [https://manifold.markets/group/league-of-legends](https://manifold.markets/group/league-of-legends)

Bonus: You can actually use the play-money you’ve earnt to choose a charity for Manifold Markets to donate to proportional to your profit! So aside from boasting rights, you are also playing for charity!",HS_SirSalty,18/03/23 01:05:51 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11tx1g4/heres_how_to_trade_league_of_legends_stocks_free/

leagueoflegends,new league of legends ranking system by ryuma (critkaisamid),"even if you have 100 kill if your team suck dick you will never climb that's a fact

riot should just do a personal rating mmr instead of the normal mmr

like lets say you lost 10 games in a row but in 10 out of 10 games you had positive kda near perfect cs good vision score then your mmr should increase because that proves you are a good player

so the mmr is based on your stats which are

combat stats

income

map control

all players in a match should have same mmr

you can't play ranked without playing 100 normal games excluding blind pick urf and aram

you can't play a champion without stats in ranked

to have stats on a certain champion you should have at least 4 mastery on him

players should have at least 3 champions with 4 mastery to play ranked

you would ask why

so that people don't get bored from their champion and pick anything else they either pick one of the champions they main or go play normals

idk i'm bored you can add by yourself",critkaisamid,13/03/23 10:03:17 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11pwzkq/new_league_of_legends_ranking_system_by_ryuma/
leagueoflegends,Smurfs in 50% of my Ranked games,"Hello

are you guys getting smurfs in half of your rankeds aswell? Im playing in High gold/low Plat and i have to deal with smurfs all the time. Its just really annoying at this point. Im am going to post my most recent games and in everyone I marked as ""smurf"", there is atleast one player that is below lvl 50. This isnt neccessarily a rant, because I use those games to practice anyways, but it still concerns me.

leagueoflegends,Hot take: Everyone should start Iron 4 every season.,"I think a major factor in the reason people stay low ELO is they never have an opportunity to play against or with high elo players, they're placed in plat every season after their placements, the rest of us never really get to learn from or see what they're doing in the context of a game we're apart of. Yeah you can watch their streams or whatever, but there's something to be gained from being in game with better players, a lot of us learn by doing not seeing.

Also most of the guides and knowledge out there is click-bait or is really hard to follow.

There's a reason we ended segregation in the united states. if you seperate all the low elo and high elo players at the season, the low elo players are going to for the most part stay low elo. there are literal studies that show this happening in our education system, Riot implemented an MMR system that mimics jim crowe and for some reason everyone defends it.

Feel free to disagree or drop your thoughts below.

**Edit,** thanks for everyone who posted their thoughts below! I think a lot of you are right in saying that it would be insane to just throw iron players in with challengers and so on, and that the gap is too large for them to learn anything. I do think that exposing players to players that are better than them to a certain degree would be beneficial, but I don't have a good idea of how to implement that. All that said, just a thought experiment, no need to get as angry as some of you are!

Sorry for the unprofessional language, I usually just press play again and forget about it after a defeat but this game really tilted me over how hard our team, who did great at everything they do, had to try and play around him just for him to do so little and outplayed us late game just by throwing R at us and did a little fly by spitting.

Average Viewership  | 294.5k | 209.2k
Hours Watched | 5.62 million | 3.6 million
Peak Viewers | 464.1k | 348.1k


Any thoughts? It was pretty obvious that this split was going to perform a little worse than Winter, since Spring always had more viewers than Summer, simply because people want to see professional LoL and the new rosters/teams after a long winter. Still a pretty big drop-off though in my opinion.

leagueoflegends,My take on how to fix Asol.,"As far as I know, W reset is one of the most frustrating parts of his kit to play against. This is why I would change:

- W reset on takedowns REMOVED.

- W base flight distance buffed (scaling lowered a bit to compensate, ends up similar or a bit below live). Possible CD buffs to considerate.

- While flying, kill participation against champions or epic monsters allows you to recast W to restart the flight in another direction.

- When you successfully get to recast E (and before doing so), the flight distance extends a flat amount (the landing point is relocated ~2 seconds of flight time away). This procs once per flight.
The extra distance would act as a 'redirect window'. 


This potentially fixes two things:

1. Adds skill expression. Now you HAVE to kill/ damage champions (or Baron/Drake) while flying if you want a proper reset, and have to react to the map after a takedown to extend your flight. 

2. Nerfs his multikill potential during late game/ his map influence. At the moment its too easy to chain kill after kill once the main threat dies. Its combo (Q during W) has not enough counterplay to be so easy to access again and again.

The idea behind these changes would be introducing a more conditional 'high satisfaction moment'  that fits the flying space dragon power fantasy. It would add a high moment to a somewhat linear kit.

You could even add a cool turning animation with particle effects around him to convey the idea that he is using his W recast to extend his flight, potentially in another direction.

What do you think about it? Do you think I target the problem with his kit that makes him so banned?",Boneyking_,13/03/23 08:02:51 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11pu9x8/my_take_on_how_to_fix_asol/

leagueoflegends,Swain but it’s a boss fight,,xmancyclops141,18/03/23 09:34:42 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11uas62/swain_but_its_a_boss_fight/
leagueoflegends,Arcane's story is a lookalike of Guild Wars 2's story,"In Living World s1 there's a girl named Ceara (Powder) who was fascinated with crafting stuff. Her mentor Omadd (Silco) made her go insane with his machine. Her name was changed to Scarlett (Jinx) and she also became schizophrenic. She killed her mentor and now she's playing with magitech (hextech) and tries to destroy the main city with it. There's a lesbian couple (Vi x Caitlyn) doing investigation stuff and a young tech prodigy (Ekko). Also the whole season is filled with toxic substance theme which I can correlate to shimmer but it's kinda far-fetched. Obviously there's more to the stories but I started to laugh after I had realised the similarities. I want to note that the Living World came out in January 2013.  


edit: there's even more similarities but won't spoil any more",marysia69420,18/03/23 02:04:49 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11tyqdd/arcanes_story_is_a_lookalike_of_guild_wars_2s/
leagueoflegends,"Will the upcoming Star Guardian Orianna also have the WR walking and idle animations? because if not, it will look so janky considering how her base model walking animations is similar to a hooligan about to cause some vandalism over a refined elegant ballerina","[https://youtu.be/roba6EwY3uU](https://youtu.be/roba6EwY3uU) 

[https://youtu.be/RS9ImCpisXU](https://youtu.be/RS9ImCpisXU)

in WR, they overhauled her animations to be much more smooth, the skin is a resounding success there

in LoL, she moves without having a straight back and I don't know shit about ballerinas except they tip toe and never have hunched backs

here are 2 screenshots from the two videos showing Orianna animations in LoL and WR

leagueoflegends,League of Legends Items MUST be reworked," As someone who has played thousands of games and is becoming frustrated with not being able to  progress past Gold in Solo / Duo Queue . I would not agree that I am a subpar player but I do have a lot to learn in terms of team mechanics. I do not believe a single item on league of legends is designed correctly at this point. too much tank items give you not only a ton of health but they also give a ton of armor making the game require less strategic input. I believe that the game shouldn't feel  so repetive and we should have to proactively build versus the champions in game. too much magic items currently give CDR , All ADC items give high attack and attack speed I miss the earlier seasons. I miss the days when the items you built mattered more.",97YoungBoy,18/03/23 08:31:43 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11u9a5t/league_of_legends_items_must_be_reworked/

leagueoflegends,Aram adjustments?,"Let me know if I just missed it because i'm fairly out of the loop of patches and changes happening especially since surrenderat20 went down but there's a couple frustrations to ARAM games that's been bugging me that I thought they were going to address?  
I thought they had plans when they did the rubble update to change long distance spam damage like nid spear and kaisa W but I don't recall any changes and still find myself getting chunked ay any point of the game and having to try to play League like it's a bullet hell diving between shots, especially if they're on a team together.  
Also, was wondering if there was anything about akshan's revive in ARAM? I despise the ability in general but in ARAM especially. I think it definitely needs a cooldown or something of sorts, really makes winning ARAMs hard when you can't push because akshan keeps reviving his team to fight and it honestly makes the games just the absolute worst experience after getting a nice team fight or a quadra and akshan last hits your carry and now youre in a 4v5 with you waiting on death timers.

leagueoflegends,What is wrong with my MMR.,"I am currently at Plat 2, and trying to reach Diamond. Everytime I win a game I get about 20-22 LP and everytime I lose, I lose about 18-20 LP.

Today I won 9 games in a row, getting 18 LP with each game. After I lost my 10th game, I lost 27 LP.

How is it possible to lose 27 LP (8 LP more than usual) after a 9 game win streak, is my MMR bad or something ?

leagueoflegends,Did riot just add Veigar’s laugh when he kills someone?,"Apparently it’s not enough that fkn pint-sized menace is running around the rift obliterating my teammates with one button courtesy of the buffs, all while being high untouchable with his cage that covers half the screen. He laughs at your lifeless corpse sadistically with no regard for emotional sensitivity. It’s almost as bad as “names ezreal, E-Z, oh you’re dead.” I can’t stand to listen to this. The sound of Veigar's laughter is sharp and piercing, like a knife scraping against a chalkboard. It's high-pitched and almost inhuman, with a haunting quality that can make your blood run cold. When you hear it, you know that something terrible is about to happen.
it's not just the sound of his laugh that's so unsettling. It's the way it makes you feel. theres a cold, dark energy behind it, like a shadowy force that's trying to crush your soul. It's as if Veigar is reveling in the pain and suffering of others, finding joy in their destruction.

The worst part is, you can't help but be affected by it. Even if you're not the one getting killed, the sound of his laughter can seep into your mind and leave you feeling uneasy for hours afterwards.

leagueoflegends,New Support Suggestions for a Thresh Main?,"Heyo, I'm  a long-time League player looking for some new characters to play. Long story short, I took a break from League with my friends for a while, and now that I'm coming bad I'm absolute dog-shit at the game again. (I wasn't that great before, but I could play a mean Thresh.)
I'm a support main and a Thresh one trick, currently I'm at around 650k mastery with him. My friends were criticizing me for bad plays and general rustiness (and doesn't help that I'm on dorm wifi,) and it's slowly sucking the fun out of the game, so I was thinking about picking up someone who doesn't need to be as quick as Thresh, if that makes sense. I also enjoy playing Soraka, Lulu, Lux, and a few others.
I primarily play for fun with my friends, I'm not interested in climbing. Just some fresh, fun champion suggestions would be appreciated. :)

EDIT: Just to add, I don't actually feel bad over what my friends say. I just want us all to be able to enjoy playing with each other, and it's not very fun to feed. It very rarely gets to the point where anyone is actually mad or anything lingers for more than like 10 minutes, and I love my friends very much.

leagueoflegends,What is the reason Kayle is not played in high elo?,"I am just trying to understand if this champ is simply ""weak"" or is there another reason for people to not pick her in masters+ 

I went through leaderboard yesterday on EUW and scrolled through every challenger and grandmaster player to see what champions they play. I found no one with Kayle in their top 3 most played champions (displayed on opgg leaderboard). Then I found that the best Kayle players are sitting in masters under 300LP. 

&amp;#x200B;

Kayle seems to have a 50% winrate according to [u.gg](https://u.gg) in plat+. If she was balanced, then why does no one play her in higher than 300LP (euw)? My theory is that stats are maybe deceiving, as 50% winrate in plat+ means nothing if there are almost no games to sample in masters+. The winrate is basically only for plat and diamond, as Kayle games above that are almost nonexistent. 

Is kayle weak? Is Kayle only balanced for low elo and very weak in high elo? Something else?",Content_Mission5154,18/03/23 05:33:49 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11u4j4g/what_is_the_reason_kayle_is_not_played_in_high_elo/

I'd love to get insight into these kinds of things because I heard someone mention ""win rate of a specific role"" as a way to mention how good a certain role is in the meta, which is bullshit because every role has a 50% win rate, but I think they meant like, the prominence of each role in specific elos.

And reason for that is "" *disrespect* "", but if we see match history every Vaevictis player we can see that most matches they all play only on supports, so they just banned main champions for all team.

leagueoflegends,Weird Ravenous Hydra Interaction With Malzahar's Voidlings,"While goofing around in practice tool, I noticed something really odd about how voidlings interact with Ravenous Hydra. Every other pet that can proc Ravenous, procs Cleave the first time they hit a target: Cleave does an AOE around the target but the Cleave itself doesn't damage the champion/minion/monster being hit, and the pet's owner heals from the AOE via lifesteal. It may be once every 10 seconds like the wiki suggests but most pets don't tend to live that long and voidlings definitely won't.

Voidlings, however, proc Cleave normally (not damaging the attack's recipient) on the first hit on a target, then continue to apply Cleave's damage's on every hit to the target but with no AOE. These Voidlings hits will just continually heal Malzahar.

Given how fragile voidlings are, I doubt it's a particularly meaningful interaction in terms of affected his build but it's definitely odd and I figured others might find it neat.",TexasMonk,17/03/23 08:12:47 PM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11tpbyw/weird_ravenous_hydra_interaction_with_malzahars/

leagueoflegends,Jungle currently feels really bad sometimes...,"This is a long-post, thanks to those who read it all and manage to tell me what I did wrong.  


So they tried to fix early ganking, making it have a bigger disadvantage for a jungler failing an early gank compared to one that keeps farming early on towards a full clear. 

So I'm in this game, playing Jarvan IV against a Nunu. He is AFK for the **first 3 minutes** of the game. During that time I full clear my Blue-side (I'm team Red, starting with botlane helping me), and I directly go towards Nunu's Blue-side as that's what I normally do when in Silver/Gold elo (Smurfing from high Plat) usually making me win jungle instantly as no one in that elo expects that. As J4 I usually have a very strong level 3 with a Knockup, Armor shred, slow and attack speed (with Conq) that allows me to win pretty much any 1v1 against any champ as long as they don't have Lethal Tempo.   


So anyways I wait for him in his Blue buff brush, since at the time I'm there he is usually clearing his wolves. I waited I think 30s (it's long but keep in mind I did not know he was AFK and just thought he was a really slow jungler lol) before I saw him "" early "" gank botlane at level 2 (he had just cameback and early ganked after red buff), so I decided to fully-clear his blue-side.   


By the time I was done, I was level 4, Nunu ganked mid and was level 3 but still had 36 Stacks and at this point in the game it meant he only did 2 camps out of his 3 Red-side camps. Yet again, he's level 3 which is not that far from me. It's 4:37 by then. We both go do a Scuttle Crab, and he instantly ganked my Botlane which are in our tower but he ganks anyways, while I go gank Toplane who has their Akali basically in our Turret. I fail my gank but we didn't loose any health, and Nunu **dies.**   


After those ganks, I go clear my Red-side (that I didn't do yet since I cleared his Blue-side) and I get a 600g lead over Nunu at that point. Now I'm level 5, Nunu is level 3, I have 40cs and Nunu as 16cs. He's at 32 Stacks of our jungle item, I'm at 26. I then back and Nunu ganks, again at level 3, midlane. My midlane dies and Nunu gets an Assist. I then go straight to where I saw him go, so his krugs, and I get his small krugs as he was there. I also manage to kill him. I even get a kill on their Support and an assist on their ADC, just before dying to their midlane since I was low health.  


**AT 8:40 SHARP,** I have 41cs, 26 Stacks, Nunu has 27cs, 26 stacks as well. Objectives were up, had vision on drake so I went on Herald, Mid turned as Nunu arrived, they stole it and the midlane killed me. I am now 2/2/1, Nunu is now 0/2/2, I have 41cs still, with 24 stacks, Nunu did his blue, got 32cs total and now is 24 stacks too. **HE EVEN GOT level 6 BEFORE ME.** From then on, I cleared my jungle he cleared his and we got equal stacks all game. That huge like 5 minutes advantage I got early-on, while he was literally AFK for 3 of those, fallen to shit because I misplayed ONCE during that Herald.",WindowsKillerQc,14/03/23 02:11:35 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11qgxpj/jungle_currently_feels_really_bad_sometimes/

leagueoflegends,Inhibitors need to be adjusted. here's why and how to do it.,"Taking inhibitors early in the game can be a double-edged sword in League of Legends, and it's not always the optimal play. Here are some reasons why:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Risk of overextending: Destroying an inhibitor early in the game can cause your team to overextend and become vulnerable to counterattacks from the enemy team. This is especially true if you don't have strong map control or vision, as the enemy team can easily catch you off-guard and turn the game around.
2. Delayed Super Minion Spawn: Destroying an inhibitor early in the game also means that super minions will spawn earlier in the game. While this may seem like a good thing, it can actually work against you, as super minions can push lanes too far, giving the enemy team a chance to farm and catch up on experience and gold.

***In my opinion, taking an inhibitor should never be a suboptimal play. Here are my thoughts on how to adjust them:***

Nerfing the enemy team's gold and experience income from a particular lane's minions after you destroy an inhibitor could create more strategic options for players and potentially add another layer of complexity to the game.

One possible benefit of this change is that it would provide a more tangible reward for taking down an inhibitor early. Currently, while taking down an inhibitor provides significant pressure and can lead to advantages, there is no immediate reward beyond the super minions that spawn in that lane.

However, such a change could also have some drawbacks. For example, it could lead to an even more snowballing game, where the team that takes down the first inhibitor gains a significant advantage that's hard for the enemy team to recover from. This could potentially make games more one-sided and less exciting.

***Here are what some potential changes could look like:***

Gameplay Changes:

* Inhibitors now reduce the enemy team's gold and experience income from that particular lane's minions by 20% for the duration of the inhibitor's effect.
* Reduced the duration of inhibitor effects and super minion spawns from 4 minutes to 3 minutes.
* Adjusted the respawn rate of minions in the lane with the destroyed inhibitor to balance out the gold and experience nerf.

These changes are aimed at making taking down inhibitors early more rewarding, while also ensuring that games remain balanced and exciting. By reducing the enemy team's gold and experience income from a particular lane, players will have a greater incentive to take down inhibitors early. However, by shortening the duration of inhibitor effects and super minion spawns, we could prevent games from becoming too one-sided and encourage more aggressive and exciting gameplay.

Please note that these are just potential patch notes and are not official changes to the game. The developers at Riot Games would need to carefully consider the impact of any changes before implementing them in the game.

Please feel free to share your thoughts on these proposed changes.",AAbattery444,17/03/23 08:34:08 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11tbsdm/inhibitors_need_to_be_adjusted_heres_why_and_how/

leagueoflegends,I can't imagine Skarner being more visually appealing as an Earth Scorpio than as a Crystal Scorpio," 

We  already have Malphite filling the niche of ""Earth elemental from  Ixtal"", reworked Skarner's lore could just be a Malphite lore rework  honestly.

Crystals are rocks, you  can make Skarner tied to Earth magic without removing an element of him  that people have known of for a long time. It's true that ""Crystal  Scorpio"" might not be the most appealing fantasy, but I think that  whoever at Riot thought that making him an ""Earth scorpio"" (aka a normal  scorpio) would be an upgrade is wrong.

Most  people find geomancy less appealing than more flashier, magical stuff:  Even the League design team was originally planning on giving Qiyana the  fire element instead of earth, and had to change because there's not a  lot of fire around the Rift.

Recently,  Skarner has gotten attention due to the whole drama surrounding the  release of Seraphine, and her use of Hextech crystals, as mentioned in  the article, it's something a lot of players are now aware of and link  with Skarner's identity, the fact that people don't mention the crystal  aspect when describing him simply means that what makes him known as a  character in the lore doesn't translate well enough in-game to make it  an iconic aspect of the champion.

I  think that the Geomancy direction is the right one, as well as the  relocalisation to Ixtal. But since crystals are basically shiny dirt, I  don't think it's necessary to remove them entirely. Maybe keep his  ""Earth crystal"" appearance that was shown in the /dev blog, and give his  shell crystal ornaments to make him appear more civilised while also  keeping the crystal theme ?

Removing the Hextech aspect of him would also be quite disappointing tbh but that's another conversation to be had",Toxic_Seraphine_Stan,18/03/23 02:24:35 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11tzaj8/i_cant_imagine_skarner_being_more_visually/

leagueoflegends,Mid champions that could use some love,"**Twisted Fate** \- Poke mage, always in threat of dying because he has no movement. Would love a movement speed boost while picking a card. Or keep E as a passive/toggle to pre-select cards. The gold passive is cool, but it should transform/change at level 11 or something.

He is great snowballing, but in close games or tank meta he does no real damage compared to other hyper scaling mid laners. Which is why people ended up building him semi-bruiser (ROA)

I would try to put him on par with Azir's scaling since they are so similar. 

**Ahri** \- Another poke mage, damage is pretty low. I would argue a boost in base/scaling in exchange for one less ultimate dash or a higher cooldown. Charm should not be effected by movement speed effects (if the enemy has ghost on they zoom into you, but if they are slowed they barely move towards your team. I would look for a good balance)

Most people would rather play a poke mid laner like Syndra over Ahri anyways. Again both similar champs, it's just one does more damage and her stun has a better hitbox... and better wave clear... and she doesn't stop to cast.

**Anivia** \- One of my old mains from when I first started league, definitely slow for sure and the Ice wall is super powerful nowadays. Crazy that Aurelion Sol can channel and ability and move.. I think this should be the new ""standard"". Anivia ult pulls back while she is moving would be nuts. That and her Q should do full damage regardless if you press Q or not, or if the explosion does damage without phasing through people (helps when you get stunned)

Again Anivia is similar to Asol, just crazily gapped in strength like the other champions I mentioned.",Nhika,16/03/23 04:25:45 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11s85wz/mid_champions_that_could_use_some_love/

The recent changes had 2 goals in mind for adc player satisfaction, in an attempt to increase the role’s popularity.

First, the shields. ADCs are the class meant to deal the most damage. This means most of their power budget is dedicated solely to dps. This leaves them very squishy and easily killable. This is balanced in coordinated and high levels of play because the team will provide enough utility and the player will be skilled enough that just assassinating the adc is only slightly easier than a front-to-back teamfight. However, for the average team and average adc player, the squishiness is extremely unforgiving, and unfun to play. One mistake without good peel sends them back to fountain, and most likely loses their team the fight. Having to stick with your team, especially when their skill levels vary feels terrible to play. The new bloodthirster and overheal changes were meant to fix that, but that makes ADCs overpowered because their high damage is balanced around their squishiness.

Second, the ie/navori changes. These were meant to decrease the amount of time ADCs take to reach their powerspikes. This is because the later your powerspikes are, the later you’re powerful enough to have impact in the game, and get to have more fun. Scaling champions inherently have less time at their strongest as not every game gets to late game, especially with ff votes. The ie and navori changes while achieving their goal also just increased the overall strength of ADCs, when they were already good.

So what’s the solution? Idk I’m not a game designer, but I think that the shielding and powerspikes changes should be kept, but all adc damage should be lowered to keep them balanced.",AzureApplez,14/03/23 06:52:32 PM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11r2yxj/the_state_of_adcs/

leagueoflegends,"Champion Concept - Veza, The Brackern Queen","**The following is a champion concept that I came up with in the midst of a random surge of inspiration while reading league lore.** (I really think the Crystal Scorpion people are cool and need more love)

Name: Veza 

Origins: Kalamanda (Revived/Awoken by Skarner)

Role: Jungle (Support Jungle)

Energy/Mana type: Uses HP

Passive; Remnants of the Crystal Scar: Veza has access to a special shop in the fountain, Allowing for purchase of (Permanent/Consumable/Temporary)

Upgrades to the Nexus, Turrets, and Minions. The currency for this shop (Nexus Shards?) is gotten in small amounts from killing allied jg monsters,

Slightly increased amounts from the enemy jg, Medium amounts from epic monsters and champion takedowns, and a (Medium-Large/Large chunk) from ALLIED turrets being destroyed. This shop opens at level 6 BUT shards can be 

earned from level 1

&amp;#x200B;

Q; Flagellation (5% max HP cost) ((Applies Crystallization)): Veza Fires off a cluster of Bracken Crystal, dealing AP damage in a small area and rooting for 0.25 seconds, if this hits a champion, a Brackling

(Baby Brackern? Lesser Species of Brackern?)

Is spawned and attacks the nearest unit, prioritizing the one that spawned it, slowing on attack and having decaying health but increasing movement speed over 1/1.5/2/2.5/3 seconds.

Health lost by casting this ability is converted into a temporary health debuff that can be restored at Fountain, or using W. (Brackling damage scales with AP) (Brackling HP scales with Bonus HP)

&amp;#x200B;

W; Life Stone (No Cost): Veza spawns a wall of Crystals, this wall has 50 Armor and 50 Magic resist, 500/1000/1500/2000/2500 (Scaling with AP) Decaying HP (7s), takes 100% increased damage from champions,

and restores health crystallization from Veza's Q at a rate of 4% max HP per second, or, if all crystalization is removed, 1%/1.25%/1.5%/1.75%/2% of Max HP is healed per second. Veza and 

any ally affected by (E) will be able to pass through this wall at 75% of their movespeed

&amp;#x200B;

E; Crystal Coating(10% Current HP cost) ((No Crystallization)): Veza bestows a small crystal that floats around a designated ally, remaining on them until changed, the ally

affected by this ability in this way will (Q: Heal and gain a small movement speed buff for damage done by Brackling) (W: Be able to pass through the wall and benefit from the Max HP heal

(Equal to their own max HP, not Veza's)) (R: While the Nexus Surge is active, if within the walls of the base they gain 10% omnivamp.) While an ally is linked in this way, Veza suffers a 5% movespeed debuff while far away, and 

5% movespeed increase when close, as they have parted with a portion of their own Life Stones.

&amp;#x200B;

R; Nexus Surge (7%/5%/3%|7% all ranks of Max HP per second TOGGLE with 10s Delay after disabled)((Possibly use Crystallization to prevent spamming it or discourage using it while in enemy base?)): Veza weaponizes the Nexus,

spawning 3/6/9 Bracklings every 2 seconds, their stats equal to any spawned using (Q). 

These Bracklings will wander down the nearest lane if no enemies are nearby, immediately beginning their decay after passing the outer turrets (Or after entering combat)((Bracklings spawned in this way have the

Nexus Surge buff, and deal 300% damage to minions)). While the Nexus is surged, it will gain increased health regen, the ability to fire at a single target (Prioritizing minions) and temporarily double 

the effects of upgrades purchased by Veza using their passive. If a turret or Inhibitor has been affected by Nexus Surge within the last (120s/100s/80s affected by CDR) they will not receive the doubled effect and instead only receieve a 10% increase.

(((THIS ABILITY IS SILENCED WHEN IN FOUNTAIN IF OUT OF COMBAT AND STOPS HEALTH REGEN FROM WARMOGS)))

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

PASSIVE SHOP (WIP, IDEAS SO FAR LISTED)

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

&amp;#x200B;

Life Stone Reinforcement (50 Shards)

Reinforce an ally structure using salvaged Brackern Crystals and give it an individualized (Stacking) buff

Turrets; For each Reinforcement used, increase armor and magic resist of tower by 2% (per, not self stacking, only uses original magic resist and armor stats of tower) (Doubled if no enemy minions are nearby)

Inhibitors; For each Reinforcement used, a slowing/chilling zone is formed around the inhibitor (375 range) that slows for 2.5% (per), applying half of that slow to attack speed.

Nexus; Adds a Brackling storage to the Nexus, (1 Brackling per upgrade), these are released in a swarm when the nexus is attacked, and regen at a rate of \[1-3 Bracklings every 10-5 (Based on Level) seconds\].

&amp;#x200B;

Brackern Construct (100 Shards)

Spawns a specialized Brackling on targeted structure \[1/2/3 Max per structure depending on ult level)

that restores 1% (Per Brackling) HP every 5s while the structure is out of combat.

&amp;#x200B;

Siege Stone (200 Shards) (TOWERS ONLY) (Max 1 Per TOWER)

Every \[15-7 Based on Level\] Minion Deaths near the tower affected by the Siege Stone will begin constructing a Siege Brackling over \[30-10 seconds Based on Level\] This melee ranged minion is prioritized over normal minions

for tower targets, similar to cannon minions, this minion doesn't attack champions and will walk straight under tower ignoring them, even if attacked. This minion attacks towers with damage similar to a cannon minion, but heals

outside of combat if it manages to destroy the tower.

&amp;#x200B;

Nature's Barracks (75 Shards) (PLACED STRUCTURE, SIMILAR TO ZZ'ROT PORTAL) ((MAX 3 ON MAP, NEWLY PLACED OVER LIMIT WILL DESTROY OLDEST))

All ALLIED minions that pass within 100 units of the Barracks are rooted(stunned?) for 0.75 seconds, and take 50% increased damage during this duration. However, at the end of the stun duration they will gain 10% increased health,

Poison damage on attack that damage 0.5% of max HP per second, for 4 seconds, (0.2% for towers) stacking up to 5 times (3 times for tower), and 20 armor and magic resist. Minions affected by this will also take on a crystallized look

for their weapons/shields/vehicles. This buff cannot be applied to the same minion more than once and lasts until death. The barracks can withstand 20 hits from minions, 5 hits from ranged champions, or 3 hits from a melee champion.

He really  could not farm. It was so miserable. Even if I was beside him or nearby, it was just insane. Twitch+Yuumi would pop up and he would die and I would be running away with 100 hp left.

leagueoflegends,The LCS is Embarrassing,"Been watching the LCS since it started but I can hardly bother any longer. This is the first time I've consistently been watching the LEC and LCK (when I am awake for it) as an alternative -- both of which have been awesome to watch comparatively. 

It seems like they doubled down on being the 'fun, doesn't take itself seriously' region. Most of the time I am watching the LCS I'm sitting through some cringe segment with one of the 'analysts'. Some are still good like This/That with Kobe+Jatt but a lot of the other segments come off as a garbage highschool video project or something. Like MarkZ's Eric Andre segments? WTF are we doing? Sure you might like the Eric Andre show but why does that mean the LCS has to try to copy it completely out of context in an eSports broadcast? 

If Meteos and Sneaky didn't stream the LCS with their own takes and most of the broadcast muted I wouldn't even bother watching. Its a clownshow. If you compare it to the LEC (which is like doubling LCS viewership on all 3 days that it runs), the LEC just seems so much more professional. Even the English LCK broadcast, which seemingly has like 1% of the budget of the LCS, is so much better. Its just a couple of people talking about the game, who are really interested in it and stay on topic in between the real content: the games. 

I do like that they are trying to get players more involved in the broadcast, but even when that happens it seems unnatural and sometimes they don't feel like they want to be involved/are uncomfortable. Especially when the interviews/analysts are constantly baiting them into trying to trash talk other teams/players and forcing drama onto them rather than let it be naturally-occurring and real.

Even the format blows. These drawn out seasons full of meaningless games are zzzz. The LEC short seasons make the games actually matter, and the LCK bo3 format is awesome too because you cant just cheese a win out on a team and say GG see you in 4 weeks when we play again. 

Anyways, I miss good LCS broadcasts. I think the numbers speak for themselves and they decide to drop all the cringe and awful format-decisions.",BIitzez,14/03/23 01:51:56 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11qgfed/the_lcs_is_embarrassing/

its also very problematic on ap supports like [heimerdinger](https://u.gg/lol/champions/heimerdinger/items) (who, after being one of the most pick/banned supports in high elo required nerfs) and of course the current iteration of [annie](https://u.gg/lol/champions/annie/items?role=support), which  has been the highest winrate support for 3 patches straight by a large margin

&amp;#x200B;

it doesnt exactly promote healthy gameplay and even though annie is not as rylai-dependent as heimer id like to think that rylai is the problem ALONG with the champions. it should just straight up not be a support budget item and be reverted back to its 3000g status

leagueoflegends,Skin ideas for every champ - P,"Hello everyone!

A short post, today we have P.

**Pantheon**

*Armored Titan*: Steel Valkyries skin, like that of Nasus.

*Pentakill*: This has some good potential, I imagine a similar look to Morde maybe.

*Empyrean*: Having looked through the skins in this group, the helmet is really what I thought of this for. Like Pyke's head or Jhin's mask, it could look very badass.

*Dawn-/Nightbringer*: Imo both would be really fitting. He has a good base for this.

**Poppy**

*Freljord*: Some fur and iced hammer.

*Poppbee*: Idk how it'd look like, but the pun works. Kinda. Maybe the hammer could be a flower?

*Little Devil*: 3 Yordles already have a skin like this (Demon for Trist), why not include her too. I think it works.

*Dragonslayer*: With that hammer, I'm sure you can kill some drakes.

*Odyssey*: I'd love to see her in a GotG type group.

**Pyke**

*Vandal*: He has the looks I believe. You could even put a tire on his shoulders in place of the jaw.

*Omega Squad*: Kinda like Fizz, a sea agent.

*Fright Night*: I mean he obviously has Jack the Ripper vibes, does he not?

*Pool Party/Scuba Diver*: As always, saved the best for last. This guy has an ability where he swims, he is perfect for this! Just put a scuba diving outfit on him and one of those fake shark fins people use on the beach and boom it's done. The mere thought of him wearing a snorkel walking around in fins is already hilarious to me. A somewhat similar alternative would be fisherman. That's funny too.

leagueoflegends,"I'm not sure, but I feel like this whole Skarner Lore ""discourse"" kind of weird.","Like, we barely got any information of his actual lore besides the main concept of who he is, who is now some sort of Guardian that is a part of a Earth elemental race that was responsible for giving the Ixtalis Earth elemental magic.

Okay, strong foundation, explores more worldbuilding of the elements within Ixtal, sets him apart within the roster as well as to other similar champs like Malphite, who is a weapon.

Yet people are already acting like that the rework is now going to be in ruins lore wise, and that it is Riot's fault for it, pointing fingers all over the place, and also claiming how the Crystal Scorpion theme is good so it shouldn't be changed (I heavily disagree with that but ok).

do we not know that Ixtal is being constantly exploited by Piltover due to not only how resourceful it is, but partly also because they did not even know of the existence of people living there until Qiyana went on a raid to the mines?

Not to mention that Skarner has some concept art of having crystal connections as well. It doesn't tell me that they are entirely going to throw out the exploitation aspect personally, especially with how some things are going recently for Ixtal in the lore.

Oh, and people are also acting like that it's an excuse to make Piltover the ""good guys"" &amp; how the tragedy of being used as a resource to power their progress is lost.

Which, is never implied at all, if anything, the sense of messed up shit that might be happening around the Hex crystals isn't like it is totally lost, they might as well make something entirely new to keep the tragic aspect to it. Not to mention of how it is said that they are trying to make it so that the lore is more cohesive with the forms of media League is having such as Arcane for example.

And Arcane makes it pretty ambiguous, as if it is a set up to explore more about it if there is time for it, and that show has some pretty messy ideas right there (Messy as in fucked up in a good way).

I just feel like that shit is way too early to conclude, and that people are just overreacting based on stuff like Seraphine, and the typical Riot hate boner that the internet community likes to spout about while pretending that they ""Care for the mains"" when they probably don't at all.

**Tldr: People are overreacting about the changes Skarners lore, and I think Riot is going to cook something much more about the tragic aspect of his old lore as compensation to twist it into a new thing about Piltover whether it is by another species, concept, or consequence with it's worldbuilding.**",BulletCola,18/03/23 06:29:11 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11u619i/im_not_sure_but_i_feel_like_this_whole_skarner/

leagueoflegends,How can I escape low elo if my teammates are worse than bots.,"I know, this question is something that would have come up tons of times, but just help me out here. I shifted to the singapore server when it came out, and have been playing there since. I decided to try out ranked but sadly had some very bad placement games and ended up in iron. Initially, I struggled to find a champ to consistently main, since i kept changing my picks and roles, but finally I decided to main akali in the midlane. My akali skills have gotten much better to the point where I almost never lose lane phase. After so many games i've finally come to the conclusion that it is no longer I who is the reason for me being hardstuck, but my teammates. They are so bad, and I have no idea how this is even possible. I get people playing a champion for the first time in ranked, i get trolls, i get idiots and i get bots. There is a limit to which i can carry, and it becomes truly impossible if i dont get at least 1-2 decent players. I always have the best kda on my team, but its not enough when the enemies are so fed. I don't know what to do now honestly. Akali is a good 1v5 champ, but my teammates make it feel like 1v99. I can play most champions in the game well, (very few exceptions like zed who im not confident with), and I can play all the roles as well (bit rusty on adc but that can be fixed). Do you guys have any tips for climbing out of this elo. I've only gotten to Iron I 25 lp before dropping back to iron II after getting afks and trolls. It seems like this server has the worst players, since a friend of mine who played in sg used his EUW account and said that the teammates were far better, and it was better playing on EUW with 200 ping than here on sg. It feels like only my teammates are the idiots and trolls, the enemies only seem to have 1 or maximum 2 bad players. Please help :(

		I want to \~suicide bomb\~ make Brand a stronger champion making him more dangerous to be on top of, given that he will be able to ""explode"" with his passive.

&amp;#x200B;

	(P)Additional Effect

		You can now land your abilities at yourself(P, W, E and R);

		(Obviously you won't take damage from that).

&amp;#x200B;

Leblanc:

	Reasoning:

		I miss you, leClone.

&amp;#x200B;

	(R)Re-Re-Revert

		Leblanc now will be able to select wich ability she will want to cast, including the ""R+R"";

		the cost of the ability will be double the cost of the selected ability (RQ= 100, RW= 120/140/160/180/200, RE= 100, RR=0);

		When she mimics one of her basic abilities, she will go invisible for 0.5s and summon one clone that will attack her enemies. 

&amp;#x200B;

Lux:

	Reasoning:

		I want to encourage mages to land more basic atacks and be rewarded for that.

&amp;#x200B;

	(W)New Effect

		your passive now is applied to enemy champions that the projectile goes through.

&amp;#x200B;

Morgana:

	Reasoning:

		One of the biggest problems with morgana is the fact that she does not have a way to deal with spellshield without making her useless when someone jumps on her, so now she can try to W an the AA someone before casting her r/Q.

&amp;#x200B;

	(P)New

		When you damage an enemy champion or Non-Small monster with an ability, you will mark them;

		Your next basic attack at them will gain (50-150) range and consume the mark (9s) to deal 10-190(+15%) magic damage in a cone area on/behind them;

		this attack will track the target but can miss (Blinking or dashing very far).

&amp;#x200B;

	(Q)Nerf

		damage (80 / 135 / 190 / 245 / 300 (+ 90% AP)) -&gt; (70 / 115 / 160 / 205 / 250 (+ 75% AP)).

&amp;#x200B;

	(W)New Wording/effect

		When you deal magic damage to an enemy champion or Non-Small monster, reduce the colldown of your W and P by 5%.

&amp;#x200B;

	(E)New Passive

		You heal for 15% of the magic damage you deal.

	

	(R)New Effect

		When the tether ends, it will consume the passive mark again.

&amp;#x200B;

Orianna:

	Reasoning:

		I want orianna to be able to have a greater power in the early game by giving her a way to stack her passive so she can unleash a powerfull AA on you, while also changing how her Q works so it can always follow up her R.

&amp;#x200B;

	(P)New Wording and Effect

		""Orianna basic attacks deal 10 − 50 (based on level) (+ 15% AP), and can be empowered by 20% for each stack of clockwork"";

		""Clockwork:

			Basic attacks toward the same target generate clockwork for 4 seconds, up to 2 additional stacks;

			When you kill an unit with an ability, you will generate more stacks of clockwork, enemy champions or or Non-Small monsters takedowns give you 5 stacks instead;

			All stacks are consumed when attacking a new enemy, if you slay it, you will gain them back (Up to 2 stacks versus minions).""

	(Q)New Effect

		Can also be cast at a very small area around the ball.

&amp;#x200B;

Syndra:

	Reasoning:

		Basically, she can ensure kills without wasting much of the uptime of her ult.

	

	(P)Max stacks suggestion

		""Unleashed Power colldown will get reduced by 10% for every Dark sphere that doesn't land at the target""

&amp;#x200B;

Vel'Koz:

	Reasoning:

		Your basic attacks already reset the duration, so I wanted to spice the champ alittle bit more, without buffing the rest of his skills.

&amp;#x200B;

	(P)New effect

		Every Third basic attack will apply one stack of Organic Deconstruction.

&amp;#x200B;

Xerath:

	Reasoning:

		Xerath is an mage that rewards precision, but duel power, those changes will not make him deal more damage at close range, but will make him interact better with itens(Rylai, Ludens, liandry, RoA...), and eventually help him escape tight situations(After 6).

&amp;#x200B;

	(P)NEW

		When you land a ability at an enemy unit it will be eletrified;

		Electrified unitys will take 5-90(10%) magic damage over one second;

		Electrified Champions deal the same magic damage in a very small area around them for the same duration;

		(His Q, W(Center), E and R lost 10(10%) damage at all levels, W(area) stays the same);

		(This cannot proc the suport item effect).

&amp;#x200B;

	(Q)Mana cost changes

		80/90/100/110/120 -&gt; 50/55/60/65/70 + 15 for every second that you charge it

	

	(W)Mana cost changes

		Now refund 10% of the cost of the ability if you land it, doubled if it's in the center.

&amp;#x200B;

	(R)New Passive and Effect

	New Passive

		When you are in one of your abilities area you will gain (5/10/15)% movement speed for one second untill you leave the area;

		(A.K.A. casting Q and walking in the range, casting W/R at yourself or being really close to an electrified enemy champion.)

&amp;#x200B;

	New Effect

		Now have a ""Sweetspot"" in the very middle that deals additional damage (like his W, but will be very smaller, about 10% of the ""area"" of the skill);

&amp;#x200B;

Zilean:

	Reasoning: 

		You cannot buff zilean in any meaningfull way without showing how op he is, so instead I made him have an incentive to interact more with the enemy laner(he usually dies doing that) and also reward him for going up close to his enemies.

&amp;#x200B;

	(P)New Effect

		Using basic attacks against enemy champions while any of you are under your spells effects (Q, E and R) will generate experience for ""Time in a Bottle"";

	(Q)New Effect

		If two units with time bombs touch each other, both bombs will explode and stun them.

&amp;#x200B;

Zyra:

	Reasoning:

		Zyra had an okay on death passive that would help her with area control, but then it got changed to an passive that does not reliably help in her department, so I traded her poke range for duel power, while also rewarding her for landing her abilities at multiple enemies.

&amp;#x200B;

	(P)NEW

		When you land a basic ability at a Bulb, Enemy champion, or Non-Small monster, it will spawn a plant based on the ability;

		Enemy champions will get marked based on the ability.

&amp;#x200B;

	(E+P)New Effect

		The plant Slow now stacks 4 times, but the slow for stack is halved;

		The plant now strikes twice, first in a small cone area and then in a single target attack;

		The plant strike now deals 55% of the original, for a total of 110%.

&amp;#x200B;

	(R+P)New Effect

		Marked enemies hit biy her Ultimate will now spawn another plant, based on the Passive mark.",Jadejaca,19/03/23 02:16:48 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11uvmzn/suggestion_spicying_up_some_mages_reposted/

However. I can't stand her constant talking. Either in the enemy team or in mine. Every ability, every action she speaks.

leagueoflegends,"why are some champions allowed to be strong for extremely long times, while other champions are instantly nerfed?","Example A: Katarina https://lolalytics.com/lol/katarina/build/?tier=d2_plus&amp;patch=13.4

you can pick any random patch that you'd like and she is always 50%+ winrate (for a supposedly hard champion) and usually at least A tier, she can also abuse items that are not intended for her like bork, wits end, hexdrinker, divine sunderer, while other assassins like fizz/ekko got nerfed half a decade ago when they could do that. katarina gets a special pass.

""oh but she isnt even S tier! only A tier!""

ok, so what about darius? https://lolalytics.com/lol/darius/build/?tier=d2_plus&amp;patch=30

champion has been S tier with high pick/ban/winrates in all elos for years now.

""oh but hes not picked in pro play!""

ok, so a champion like the ones above but also played in pro play is draven, the champ literally shaped the entire metagame around because riot wont nerf him https://lolalytics.com/lol/draven/build/?tier=d2_plus&amp;patch=30

pick any random patch and youll see he is doing very good for a 'hard champion' (realistically draven playstyle doesnt work on any other champion because he is that overpowered when mastered aka you have to click to the sides while fighting with axes)

then we take champions such as gangplank, who historically has been bad in soloq for years, he was broken (darius/draven level) for a patch or two because riot randomly buffed him right before buffing his items, almost as if it was an excuse to nerf him later https://lolalytics.com/lol/gangplank/build/?tier=d2_plus&amp;patch=30

when he had same stats as darius has had for years then he instantly gets nerfed+his items even though he wasnt too popular in pro play.


lets use another example, veigar has been garbage since his last round of nerfs around durability, a champion who was only playable in mid was one of the worst mids in the game, then he gets a deserved buff and suddenly becomes good at his niche, picked a few times in pro and instantly nerfed again https://lolalytics.com/lol/veigar/build/?tier=d2_plus&amp;patch=30

how is it fair as a player who enjoys gangplank, veigar that my champs are not allowed to be good, while my friends who are darius/kata/draven otps can enjoy playing soloq without fear in their hearts that their champion will get buffed? i dont understand, you can argue gp is good in pro or whatever but veigar only works in specific comps and is not blind pick worthy, just actually works at his niche (vs low range comps that he can scale vs) while previously he failed even at that.

tl;dr why do some champions get 15 minutes of fame while others are naturally strong? its probably just a popularity thing right? riot is a business and we are the customers after all.",Ok_Regular_9436,14/03/23 07:21:53 PM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11r3i4o/why_are_some_champions_allowed_to_be_strong_for/
leagueoflegends,A suggestion to the lobby system!,"So last couple of years (except for this one lol) you could look up each other through [op.gg](https://op.gg) and ensure themselves that there are no first timers (meaning they pick a champion they never played before) in the team. If there was, you could just simply dodge. Since the lobbies are anonymized, you can no longer look up anymore. So here's my suggestion to that. What about we put 10k-20k mastery points limit on all champions before you can play them on ranked games? This will contribute with more skilled players and fairness in rankeds games.

How?

If they don't get to play whatever they want, as we put 10k-20k mastery points limit, they will be forced to either:

1. Play normal games
2. Play champions they know how to play.

We can only hope that they choose alternative 1 as normals are for fun, for practice, for learning etc... if you lose the game, there's literally nothing you can lose except for the xp, in which you do in ranked games aswell. If they choose alternative 2, and it's off-role, people will just dodge. And that's what dodging is for. In the end, nobody will want to play with this tilted player until the tiltness has gone away.

I noticed that in this season, it took 150 more games to get to my elo (around plat 3-2) than it usually did. I guess it is because I only play solo and I'm adc main. It'a usually harder to help your team win the game when a solo-laner is stomped to ground because of the decision of picking a champion you do not play. This was easily prevented by dodging!

So all in all,  this is just a suggestion that could prevent stomped laners in ranked games and helps obviously more skilled players to win the game. It also helps the state of league of legends to stay healthier!

Edit: I just want to also mention that this will also keep the ""banned toxic smurfs"" from being toxic again as they will not want to achieve 10k mastery points on all 16 champions again. This will also solve the issues with selling bot-leveled accounts. As for now, I know there are a lot of bots in lower leveled games...

leagueoflegends,Zyra Rework Idea,"I think that Zyra is a very cool support and at times can be fun to play but she’s just highly outdated and literally Heimerdinger does everything she does but better. His turrets are easier to create, his poke is immensely better, his CC potential is a little weaker but faster than Zyra’s and his ult is actually useful and if he messes his ult, his ult has a lower cooldown, keyword IF, whereas with Zyra you cannot ult without hard CC or rylais cuz enemies WILL dash or straight up wall out of it. So I think she needs something different.

Disclaimer: I am not familiar with coding game balance changes or anything so for numbers I will be using variables so that no one thinks “this ability would suck because 500 damage isn’t enough that’s weak”, I will leave the calculating to the experts unless I need to use specifics to make points.

Passive: Fatal Fauna- Damage from Painful Spores (Q) and Thorn Spitter (W) and CC from Thorn Spitters (W) and Stranglethorns (R) [and Everfrost] will apply Poison to the enemy dealing percent max health magic damage over 4 seconds. Repeated Procs will not increase damage but instead reset the duration. Any outside sources of percentage damage will not deal damage but instead stack attack speed on her Thorn Spitters (So Liandry’s deals about 12% max health damage so that would instead grant her Thorn Spitters half of a 1,000% increase to 12 [120], into 60% attack speed). The second half doesn’t need to be a thing but just as a thing if they want to de incentivize Liandry’s building without completely ruining/ blocking out buying the item

Q: Painful Spores- Zyra throws a ball of spores dealing X damage and Nearsights them for a short few seconds. If Painful Spores touches her Thorn Spitters, it will heal them by 2.

W: Thorn Spitter- Zyra summons a plant to a target location (Not discussing stats just imagine it’s same as live Q plants) dealing x magic damage to nearby targets or whoever Zyra deals damage to. If Zyra gets crowd controlled, Thorn spitters will lob a ball of poisonous goo at the attacker if they are an enemy champion, if they are in range, stunning them for x second(s). Can only happen once every 15-ish seconds. Zyra gains an extra charge of Thorn Spitters at level 5 and 9.

E: Bark Skin- Zyra applies Bark skin to a target ally or herself for x seconds granting them x damage reduction based on her Ability Power and Heal and Shield Power. Anyone affected by Barks skin also receives increased healing and shielding based on her Heal and Shield Power for Half the duration. This does count as a shield for Ardent Censer, Staff of Flowing Water, Shurelyas and Moonstone.

R: Stranglethorns- Passive: Nature Gives Back, Any Enemy champion slain in Stranglethorns will grant the kill to the ally with the highest multi kill streak, and then second priority goes to the nearest ally within a certain range. Zyra then is granted a Bountiful Seed in her inventory granting her Kill gold when used. Active: Zyra summons a monstrous thicket at the target location that deals magic damage to enemies hit as it expands. Enemies inside Stranglethorns are Grounded and take Fatal Fauna damage. Her Thorn Spitters charges are reset upon casting. Lasts for x seconds. 

My Thoughts: I think this kit would be a lot of fun to use and would be healthy as to semi prevent Tank Zyra (which they hated so badly I guess…) and full blown damage Zyra (Damage supports are honestly unhealthy for the game because they dominate low elo and are completely absent from high elo cuz of their need for money to build AP and be useful, which only works in low elo cuz they can KS or hyper punish bad positioning) and I think this is a middle ground where Zyra will be doing damage but I don’t see enemies raging at this iteration of Zyra if balanced correctly. I made sure all DoT was tied to her passive cuz passives can’t stack Liandry’s (look at AP Twitch for example, which is fairly balanced to an extent in support without needing Liandry’s).",Deordos3,14/03/23 03:52:16 PM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11r034q/zyra_rework_idea/

leagueoflegends,new yuumi passive is punishing instead of rewarding,"Yuumis new passive gives you a ""best friend"" so you get bonus stuff when staying on him and he gets an on-hit heal that's disgusting.

I have several problems with this:

1. Passivity: It encourages you to stay on your adc even more than the old one. Your heal can proc only every 15s on avg, which is higher than q cd. So there's no need to aa enemies anymore (except for dmg, but you're a squishy ball of 0 dmg) en contraire: You take the on-hit healing from your adc if you do it. So not being on your adc is basically grieving.
2. Visibility: Nowhere is shown, how many stacks there are. The passive tells me who is the most loved, but literally nothing indicades how much. Not on me, not on my allies, nowhere. There's no scaling on it, but if you wanna switch, you have no clue how long it takes to get a new best friend.
3. Dependency: This is the worst part. Since you are now best staying in your adc for the first 10 minutes straight, you have a lot of stacks of your passive on them. Or just some, or a fckton, man nowhere can i even see the stack value. Now imagine your adc is not the most useful player and you have a fed top/jgl like olaf where you also can give your full potential. You now have to spend years to get the same amount of stacks as you did on your adc. In this process you lose about 30% (?) of your power. A top is not happy with you sharing their XP just because you need passive stacks. So you either stay useless on adc, or you are useless or even damaging to your team trying to get useful later on.
4. Worth: Yuumi has to stay on the best friend to get the potential of any other enchanter. No other enchanter has this problem. You try keeping your adc alive, but in 1/4 cases you can't keep your **carry** alive. You are just not good enough without this passive.

All in all this feels like a ""don't lane or you lose any purpose"" situation. This is 100% only about the passive and not about any other numbers. She might still be broken, but losing with her feels even worse than adc against 5 fed assassins.

Edit:
Maybe that point went under the stone, but new passive encourages you to do the very passive q-only never leaving playstyle people complained about. But now yuumi has no other choice but to do so. Only thing that changed is she is bound to her adc instead of top/ mid, so you have even less decisions to impact the game.",vide2,12/03/23 11:14:35 PM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11pgw2f/new_yuumi_passive_is_punishing_instead_of/
leagueoflegends,How is the game currently?,"Hey!
I've recently became interested in playing League again, but haven't played in around 1-2 years. How is the game doing? It feels like I don't see it getting as much attention and coverage as before.
How is the meta currently? Are the new changes any good? (I know that JGL is now very different with pets and stuff)

leagueoflegends,What is a gameplay fantasy that is exclusive to ONE champ?,"I mean a gameplay experience which is conducive to a massive dopamine surge and pretty much represents the ideal scenario for a particular champ, but one that is exclusive and unique to only one. 

  
There are certain fantasies that can be achieved and few super satisfying, like ulting a gigafed carry as mordekaiser and winning the team fight by keeping them in a vulnerable zone. But this is redundant in a way since jarvan, Camille, and Xin can do more or less the same thing. 

  
Other redundant fantasies include transforming into a raid boss with your ultimate, which is perhaps the most generic one since so many champs have it. There include trundle, nasus, renekton, volibear, aatrox, swain, singed, Olaf, Mundo, jax, shyvana, and ksante.",Pandini23,14/03/23 11:38:11 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11qvja0/what_is_a_gameplay_fantasy_that_is_exclusive_to/

leagueoflegends,"How to fix lethality, pen and tanks","The problem is that 45 armor negates 3 lethality items. Make lethality based on level and increase it. For example, 18 lethality turns into 15-30 lethality and dirk into 8-15 lethality based on level. 10 lethality gets buffed to 12-20 based on level. Lower defense on lethality items, nerf eclipse shield, low stealth duration on duskblade etc.

How to fix armor pen abuse: make the armor penetration consider Moreso lethality, it doesn't need to be the adc items, just the one with the slow. Make the last whisper item with the slow weaker if you don't have lethality and stronger if you have lethality. A bruiser would need to buy full lethality to benefit.

Edit: Deleted tank idea because it seemed counter intuitive.",Gamer_AC,19/03/23 08:35:33 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11v633t/how_to_fix_lethality_pen_and_tanks/

leagueoflegends,ADCs feel like they have 2 mythic items,"TLDR: Crit items feels like second mythic for marksmen (must have item), similar when sunfire tank items felt bad on a lot of tanks. In my opinion it would be good to change it too.

Last season every tank was forced to buy Sunfire mythic item which didn't feel good at all. If I take similar approach to crit mythics. It doesn't feel good to have 2 mythic items. I'll explain: Every game every single marksmen build crit modifier. It doesn't matter if it's IE, Navori or Rageblade. At least 2 items are always must have every single game for every single champs in that role. Mythic because of stats and crit modifier because of how important it is to have it. So it makes feel like ADCs have 2 mythic items in some way. I made some post when new mythic came last season but back then riot thought that mythic items are going to be situation items. After a year it is mostly about what item is the strongest right now + champ prefs + player prefs and the last is I'm going to buy Liandry's instead of Luden's because they have a lot of tanks. In my humble opinion I think this trinity should be mythic (IE, Navori and Rageblade) and current mythic's should be changed to regular items because they are not champs+player specific but game specific (to survive, to kill tanks, to have higher mobility if I shortcut the choice). That would cut the feeling that ADCs have 2 mythic items. 

Quick look how could champ core build looks if enemy have some default team + counting with 13.6 nerfs:  
Caitlyn - IE =&gt; RF =&gt; Galeforce =&gt; LW   
Lucian - Navori =&gt; ER =&gt; LW // IE =&gt; RF =&gt; LW  
Ezreal - ER =&gt; Navori =&gt; BT  
Jhin - IE =&gt; Collector =&gt; RF  
Xayah - IE =&gt; RF =&gt; BT/Galeforce  
Kalista - Rageblade =&gt; Hurricane =&gt; BT  
etc.

These changes could look like this:  
**Proclaimer**: stats/numbers could be overtuned/undertuned, mythic items could be change totally better way. (I'm not paid for this ) I used multiple different sources for number like gold efficiency, similar items, etc. + mythics have gold efficiency about 10% higher but it can never match real testing. I tried to buff full on-hit crit path more because it's weak right now:

Navori Quickblades - 3400G

20% crit - 800 G  
UNIQUE – SAVING GRACE: Upon taking lethal damage, you gain a shield that absorbs 35% based health for 3 second. During this time, if you score a takedown against an enemy champion, your health is set to value of the shield. (300 second cooldown)

leagueoflegends,Skin ideas for every champ - O,"Hello everyone!

The next three posts including this one will be short, since O,P and Q don't have much champs, but then R and especially S will be tough jobs. Anyways, let's focus on O for now.

**Olaf**

*Mecha Kingdoms*: Doesn't have a robot style skin yet, so I thought why not give him one. From all the options, I found this the best.

*Odyssey*: Doesn't have a *space* style skin yet...

*Gladiator*: If he was born in Noxus, he'd sure be one. Kinda easy money for someone who will die in their sleep.

*Primal/Tribal/Prehistoric*: Huge caveman vibes if you ask me. Probably that's the case with vikings in general I guess.

*Bloodbeard*: DnD/Rift Quest skin. This guy is the definition of the barbarian class. Naturally, name's exchangeable.

*Nightbringer*: Just a cool, vfx oriented skin. Still, it's somewhat fitting I reckon.

**Orianna**

*Cafe Cuties*: With Ori, it's easy, 'cause you can make infinite amount of things from the ball. CC outfits are perfect for her, she's cute and similarly to Bard, you can make the ball into a teapot.

*Ormeowna*: Cat ears, yarn ball.

*Dragon Trainer/Monster Taimer*: Ball is...you get it.

*Football/Basketball/Volleyball*: Literally anything works.

*Bewitching*: The classic, iconic, good ol' jack-o'-lantern. Never fails.

*Disco Orianna*: Left the best for last. I imagine this as a legendary, hell maybe even ultimate. Afro hair, funny, big, coloured sunglasses, shiny, glittery wide leg jumpsuit, platform heels, and of course, the ball is the disco ball. I expect nothing less than the best Ctrl+3 in the game.

**Ornn**

*Engineman*: CHOO-CHOO!!

*Captain*: He definitely got the beard for a pirate look. Ult calls the ship.

*Dragon God*: Got the horns and he breathes fire. What else do you need. Ult calls a dragon.

*Santa*: Once again, he got the beard for the job, and he also has a fitting body. Ult calls the sleigh.

Now I'm not saying that this happens in every game, I'd say it doesn't even happen in most of the games, but in the games that it does happen I'm just lost. 

My question is this; what do I do? I am not always comfortable with diving the enemy lane simply because dives are sometimes such coinflip to coordinate with random team mates, not to mention some champions are just impossible to dive. 

It also infuriates me when trying to take dragons; my botlane shoves in the wave, so I ward the enemy jungle and ping for a dragon, just for my adc to completely ignore me and just attack the tower/take a few minions. 3 extra minions or one tower plate &gt;&gt; Dragon I guess. (Yes it also happens after a sucessful gank botlane, we get a kill or two/burn their summs and ults and push the wave in together. I am also aware of what the enemy midlaner is doing before making a dragon call).

I don't wanna sound like ""M'uh team mates are holding me back from reaching my true potential"" as this is not at all what I'm implying. I really just wanna know how you guys, who are most likey far better junglers than me, deal with this?",ImprovementNo5096,18/03/23 01:48:18 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11ty9yt/need_advice_as_a_jungler/
leagueoflegends,first wave xp range should be increased,"&amp;#x200B;

as title is saying , first wave xp range should be increased

right it feels really bad to lose top lane ( idk about other lanes ) just because your enemy champ counter picked u or his champ is stronger level 1

enemy team picks an olaf or something and zone you from the first 3 minions xp , he will have the lvl lead on you and you can't contest the wave and if he does not make a mistake he snowball from there 

if we increase the first wave xp range it will remove this unhealthy cheese",nightlesscurse,18/03/23 01:37:11 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11txz2u/first_wave_xp_range_should_be_increased/
leagueoflegends,Why are ranked matches so unbalanced?,"I don't understand what it is with ranked matches. I don't mind having good opponents. I'm gold 2 trying to climb to platinum. I notice I often get matched against people who are try-harding to get out of plat as well; you can tell by their k/da and as they're probably the one calling the shots on the macro. I don't mind playing against people my level and improving through that. I've solely believed that I'll get to plat as time goes by as every game I'm able to improve.   


What I don't get is the skill level in matches. How is it that the enemy jungler can go 8-1 with full objectives while I have a First Strike - Red Kayn with Prowlers against a tanky enemy composition? How the heck is it possible that the enemy aurelion sol goes 16-0 whereas my azir goes 2-6 when he never even got camped? I wouldn't mind if this was a 3 out of 10 matches kind of thing but it happens so often.  


I'm an ADC main so there's really not much I can do. I've ended games with good k/da and usually good macro and map positioning, but there really is a limit to how much I can carry when the only tank / peeler in my team goes assassin or when my support picks a Yuumi against a thresh / lux and caitlyn. I'm not deluded enough to think that I'm some diamond smurf in gold. I'm gold and I just want to climb, but I find it really hard when my team and the enemy are divisions apart. Sometimes it's not even that my team is bad, but that the enemy is just way too good, and that's even MORE frustrating.  


I don't mind being in gold for the time being, but if the enemy is going to get an ASOL capable of going 16-0, at least get me a mid in my matches that can keep up with that guy. The more frustrating thing is when enemies notice my value during team fights (As I'm usually a fed ADC) and my teammates don't. 3 of their fed people dive me while my team chases after a 2-4 Caitlyn with 3 items in 34 minutes. In those moments, all that macro and micro knowledge isn't going to do squat when the The Vi with ghost, Sejuani and Yorick get on in my face with no one even trying to stop them.  


I believe that I can carry myself eventually out of this elo hell, but it's just really frustrating to experience firsthand that there are JUST some games you cannot carry no matter how hard you try, because in the end league is a team game, and as an ADC that becomes even more apparent.",Nemofira,16/03/23 11:20:58 PM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11sx337/why_are_ranked_matches_so_unbalanced/
leagueoflegends,"Yesterday, not a single LFL team was locked for playoffs. Today, 2/3 of their teams going to EU Masters autoqualify.","[here is the current standings of the LFL, where 3 teams qualified for playoffs merely yesterday, one of which qualified off of losing a game.](https://imgur.com/a/27Z80M6)

As you can see this league is uber-competitive. There's no real top dog, and the difference between first and seventh can actually be two games.

[Sadly, two teams will autoqualify for EU Masters due to a playoffs format that only could have been cooked up in Europe](https://imgur.com/a/6VZtSnA)

As you can see, **playoffs has 6 teams, 4 in lower bracket, 2 in upper bracket. top 3 qualify, but 1st and 2nd seed are automatically top 3**. In a league where the difference between 2nd and 5th seed may not even be a game, but rather head to head or tie breaker, **a lower bracket team must win 2 best-ofs to qualify for EU masters, while an upper bracket team can lose two in a row and still qualify**.

This is especially embarassing because a standard 6-team bracket with either a third place match or a losers bracket has been effective for years in league of legends circuits at choosing the 3 best teams to send to bigger tournaments.

Last year, this format absolutely fucked the NLC, as they had to send JDXL, who had recently kicked **EMENES** to EU masters. They lost nearly every game once they dropped EMENES, however, they had enough regular season wins to automatically qualify for the tournament, when they racked up losses against teams that didn't even qualify for playoffs after EMENES left. The team wasted a slot and embarassed themselves in play-ins.",PlzDontBanMeDong,17/03/23 01:03:53 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11szuk1/yesterday_not_a_single_lfl_team_was_locked_for/

leagueoflegends,Specific Professional or even League based Skin Line Idea,"As someone who has played league since around season 2, I’m a bit surprised I haven’t seen any ideas for a skinline like this before(or maybe just haven’t been observant enough) but I though I would atleast put it out there to see some of the crowd sentiment about it. As we all know by now, Riot prioritizes skins for popular champions as they are more likely to be sold(Lux, Ahri, Ezreal, you get the idea). Which is why I’m a bit surprised this idea hasn’t been floated around more.

My idea was for riot to take a collective look at the champions with the highest presence across pro play in all regions and make a skinline themed around those champions. Clearly they have the popularity to each individually have a skin made for them, but now they actually have good context and reasoning behind actually making a skinline for them. Not only that but they could even add small nods to players or teams who gave them the most value throughout the year. I know this would probably be a bit conflicting with the world championship skins, but I don’t think the skins themselves even have to be related to proplay, just the champions.

TL:DR - Riot should take the champions with the highest presence in pro play for each role and make a skinline for all 5.

Any feedback or ideas appreciated!",MvBart1,17/03/23 09:13:49 PM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11tqrjq/specific_professional_or_even_league_based_skin/

leagueoflegends,More explanations/thoughts regarding Swain Toggle Ultimate Rework suggestion.,"This is a follow-up post. Original Post:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11oll1d/swains\_satisfaction\_and\_fantasy\_issues\_explained/](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11oll1d/swains_satisfaction_and_fantasy_issues_explained/)

Swain's current satisfaction/fantasy problems and the changelist are included there. I made several edits to make it more organized and added a few more changes. Go take a look if you haven't read it!

I wanted to share some more thoughts regarding that changelist.

So, the core change in my suggestions is the ultimate rework.

**Why would I choose to rework the Ult?**

The main goal while thinking of how to fix Swain's issues was to transfer strength and synergy from Liandry's burn passive to raw Ability Power. The reason for that is that Swain's kit (mostly his R and Q) have amazing synergy with Liandry's passive. As a result, for Swain to have an infinite R (changed from 12 seconds) in the mid scope, his ratios had to be toned down all across his kit, to make that first item power spike both healthy to feel in-game and also win rate-wise. From the mid scope changes:

\-Q: 96% AP &gt;&gt;&gt; 70% AP

\-W: 70% AP &gt;&gt;&gt; 55% AP

\-R Drain Damage: 14% AP &gt;&gt;&gt; 10% AP

\-R2 damage: 100% AP &gt;&gt;&gt; 60% AP (The 100% AP ratio was mostly what made him scale into a burst mage, which nobody liked, so I think this nerf was the only one that didn't disrupt his fantasy)

**Why did low damage ratios hurt Swain's gameplay fantasy?**

This is basically why his fantasy was disrupted in the mid scope. With lower ratios, high AP items on Swain felt worse and worse up to a point that Liandry's + Rylais combo became the normal build on Swain. He abuses these 2 items' spell effects so well, his whole purpose in the game is to survive long enough to apply them. But the thing is, both of these spell effects don't scale, and neither do Swain's abilities scale well with high AP. So Swain transformed from a scaling battlemage that he was for 12 years into a utility, ""Rylais machine"" mage as I like to call him, and this just... doesn't feel like Swain. I am not asking for his R2 ""nuke"" explosion to come back like it was before the mid scope. What Swain needs, like a design and fantasy, is his DPS to scale well during the game, not his burst. Thus why I removed R2 damage in my change list.

So, with Rod of Ages back in the game (which btw, always was the default Swain item until it got removed), and Swain's pick rate descending more and more every patch, I think it's a good time to change Swain to fix his fantasy and make him satisfying for the players, by fixing the scaling aspect of his fantasy and making the Rylais machine identity optional.

**How my rework makes RoA the optimal item, and why removing Liandry's burn powerspike helps Swain's fantasy**

His ultimate can be reworked to make Rod Of Ages eternity passive optimal. The core changes are making the ultimate drain mana every second, and nerfing the healing ratio from it quite a bit. This way, Liandry's becomes ... Maybe not unviable but it becomes awkward to build, and not his best item win rate-wise.

So, by making RoA's raw AP Swain's main power source (alongside the damage from R2 removed change), his damage AP ratios can be buffed all across his kit to compensate for the missing Liandry's passive. So even though Swain might be a bit weaker when he finishes his 1st item, by continuing to build high AP items, he will scale as well as he should, and as he has, for the past 12 years before the mid scope happened.

This way, with every AP item the player builds, they will feel the satisfaction of Swain's kit evolving, rewarding them for that AP, by doing more DPS, similar to pre-VGU Swain.

**New Build Choices for the Swain players**

As a 2nd item, the players will finally have the choice to decide what to build: Seraph's or Zhonyas as a defensive option, Cosmic for ability haste, Demonic for %HP damage.

Rylais will also be an optional item, as it always should have been. The reasons:

\-Buying Rylais will make players feel the lower damage, as Swain will benefit more (DPS-wise) from other items.

\-His new ultimate design, not turning off when Swain isn't draining enemy champions, alongside the lower cooldown, will make not buying Rylais more forgiving.

In essence, the higher AP ratios Swain has, the more optional Rylais becomes which is a healthy design. But Swain's Liandry's power spike needs to be gone if Swain was to have higher ratios.

**The new demonflare mechanic lowers reliability on Rylais even more**

Speaking of Rylais, my R rework apart from rewarding the Swain player for building other items other than Rylais, also introduces a new version of Demonflare (R2). A 30% slow with no damage every 5 or 10 seconds, lowers the reliability of Rylais.

**R cooldown being lowered**

With R2 damage removed and 1st item powerspike also removed, while making the ult drain mana, I think the ultimate's cooldown can be lowered to pre-VGU Swain cooldowns. This cooldown buff would help top lane Swain a bit too, which I know most of his original mains played him there. It would also speed up his waveclear when he needs to back fast, which, as an immobile mage, is very useful. This change is a secondary change, so riot could make it whatever they find balanced. It could be 25/20/15, 30/25/20, 40/35/30, 60/50/40 etc.

**Other QoL changes Swain's kit could use:**

That's all about how I am trying to fix Swain's scaling and itemization. On to the QoL changes:

**Q not piercing champions**

In my changelist, I said his Q could be reverted to not piercing champions (minion pierce still exists). I think this is a sacrifice that Swain players would be okay to make if we got more damage in Q in return. Swain's entire kit is AoE anyway. I think having his main DPS ability be ""single"" target that deals more damage would be nice for 1v1 encounters and satisfying to see higher damage numbers on-screen.

**E's damage being transferred to the explosion only**

This change is just to make landing E more satisfying, so on screen, we see the entire of its damage being dealt at once. The ability doesn't do damage over time anyway, so why not put all of its burst into one thing?

All in all, these are my thoughts/motivations behind the R rework suggestion. I hope I explained it well enough.

Basically, we have one group that is arguing there is (or was) a distinctly separate queue specifically for ""smurfs"", and then we have another group that says ""smurf queue"" is kind of a misnomer and not actually a distinctly separate queue, but rather a method of matchmaking that takes into account a visible rank, and a hidden rank (MMR).

leagueoflegends,ADC Mythics don't benefit from ADC items.,"When it comes to mage mythics, every stat a mage wants feeds into the value of the mythic: Mpen boosts Liandry burn and Ludens pop, raw AP increases the stat value and haste increases the uptime. 

Yet when it comes to ADC mythics, the items mostly exist in a vacuum and don't scale with the items; crit rate and crit damage don't improve Kraken, Gale or Shieldbow, and neither armour pen nor giant slayer phys improve Kraken nor Galeforce damage. Furthermore Runaan's and Rageblade do nothing to stack Kraken faster outside of their base stats.

In my opinion, both Galeforce and Kraken Slayer should do physical damage with added scaling with crit rate and crit damage, Shieldbow should scale with crit rate and Kraken Slayer should have armour pen as a mythic passive. 

When it comes to Runaan's synergy, obviously it would be a bit broken to 3 hit every AA, but I think something like -20%AD on 3rd hit in exchange for +6.67%AD on hit would be a compromise that would make the 2 on hit legendaries work with the on hit mythic, without making them too overpowered.",MegaEmpoleonWhen,16/03/23 10:27:34 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11shhj7/adc_mythics_dont_benefit_from_adc_items/

leagueoflegends,What LCS team has had the fewest players signed for them since franchising? LEC?,"Pretty much the title. With the high rate of turnover in pro LOL, I think it would be interesting to look at the orgs, if any exist, that have been pretty good with keeping players and not switching them out too much.  


The reverse would be good too, orgs with the most players signed for them from 2019 on. So if someone could do the math for me and share, that'd be lovely.",NSamurai22,17/03/23 01:34:12 PM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11ti8am/what_lcs_team_has_had_the_fewest_players_signed/

leagueoflegends,The Insec Lee Sin play is nearly 10 years old!,"[The famous Lee Sin play](https://youtu.be/T9jeFqgd5pw)

I started playing LoL in late 2011 and was very into it by 2013. I remember seeing this play and it absolutely blowing the minds of everyone watching.

It felt like this was a pivotal point in League mechanics. Stuff this complex wasn’t viewed as practical in a game. But I remember this encouraging players to try new things. Within the next year or two, crazy mechanics like this became the norm. A legendary moment to be sure.

Is it just me and my rose colored glasses? Lemme know if you remember this moment and if it’s as golden as I think it is. Or if I’m capping",Scoimies,15/03/23 10:00:31 PM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11rx9nu/the_insec_lee_sin_play_is_nearly_10_years_old/

With this loss, Karmine Corp (7-10 record) are OUT of LFL Playoffs contention.

Example:

&amp;#x200B;

Xayah: ""You always have the worst ideas!""

Rakan: Well... You don't know the result until you try.""

&amp;#x200B;

Xayah: ""I feel you are going without me.""

Rakan: ""Oh, not this again.""

&amp;#x200B;

Rakan: ""Please, don't be mad.""

Xayah: ""I'M NOT ANGRY!""

leagueoflegends,"Every time mythics got nerfed because of bruisers abusing them, but nobody seems to ask why bruisers need another class mythics.","Jak'sho was nerfed because of bruisers, eclipse was nerfed because of bruisers twice, shieldbow was nerfed because of bruisers, now prowlers is gona be nerfed because of bruisers.

At the same time:
 Stridebreaker and Trinity sit on comfortable 1% pickrate, gore sits on 2% pickrate while Sunderer have 6%.

Ah also we cant forget about Riftmaker, one and only AP bruiser muthic that have even less pickrate than all above.

Bruiser class effectivly have one mythic: divine sunderer. Champions who cant use divine effectivly go eclipse. Gore and stridebreaker dont exist if you are not lee sin/garen. Trinity has worse build path than rabadon while not providing as much stats.

Other classes have unpopular or underwhelming mythics like crown or mandate, but bruisers have one mythic items that they can use.

Why those mythics are unpopular? Lets look on mythic design of other classes: ADC lacks burst, mobility and surviveability. Adc have kraken, galeforce and shieldbow that ate xover those weak spots. Mages are different so they mythics too. Mage lack reliable cc? Build Everfrost. Lack followup? Nightharvester and protobelt is here for you. Lack survivability? Build RoA to get free 600 hp or crown if you are a clown.

What weak points of bruisers cover their mythics? Are you having build in omnivamp? Too bad then because gore will not alow you to survive 1v3 and run away unless giga fed anyway. Do you have a tool to get on top of your target already in your kit? Too bad then you will never apply stridebreaker slow to a kiting adc. Are your champ good at splitpushing. Too bad no point in building Trinity then. Are your champ can use sheen? Build divine.

Fed bruiser ment to win duels in the melee range as well as fed adc ment to win teamfightsif not in the melee range of assasin/bruiser. Adc gets tools he needs for this. Bruisers get only win duels amplifier(divine and trinity) while items that should allow them to have more chances against ranged champs(stridebreaker) or in teamfights (gore) are nerfed to the ground or does not have functions they need to. Also mythic that alows bruiser to be frontlainer to a team is not exists at all because there is no bruiser mythic that gives you resistances.

Divine is uninteractive and unfun item at the first place while also being overtuned as hell needs to go as the only mythic for bruisers so you can have some build devercity in the class",Crime_of_Prometheus,13/03/23 04:39:56 PM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11q48rn/every_time_mythics_got_nerfed_because_of_bruisers/

leagueoflegends,Need help with jungle advice,"So I've played league off and on for a very long time and I'm kind of struggling at the moment.

I'm currently bronze and the struggle is real. I like playing support but it's pretty much impossible to carry yourself out of bronze just playing support so I've switched back to jungle but it's tough.

The hard part isn't map awareness, ganking, or farming. It's playing around my team.

The number one issue I'm having is around objectives. I watched a very helpful video recently about how all too often teams throw games by being too invested in taking dragons, that being said early dragons during laning phase is certainly helpful. It seems more times than not when I'm attempting to solo dragon, and I ping for help (to avoid having it stolen or getting ganked) or just let my team know what I'm doing, the only people that respond is the opposing team. I'll have mid leave lane and bot leave lane and show up with their jungle to gank and steal. Which makes sense, but what doesn't make sense is how often my team refuses to assist in these situations. People refuse to follow their lane to the objectives to assist and instead allow me to get ganked. It's very rare that any lane will come to dragon to help no matter how I ping, or how well their lane is pushed or anything else. The only people that show up is the enemy team. 

Okay so fine, I'll just not risk taking dragon. But then their team ends up getting dragon. The support never wards anything and when I ping the enemy taking dragon, mid/bot once again refuse to stop them. So my team both won't help taking or punishing dragon, but they continue to ask for ganks and complain if they lose lane when they have a champ advantage.

And then it's more or less the same for rift herald. I try to ping my team for rift herald, and the enemy team and jungle will show up to punish. It seems it's always the worst case scenario. This makes me not want to even think about objectives and instead farm jungle and look for ganks. And well I've had some success with this, getting a good kda going early game and getting at least one lane fed, but then it falls apart after laning phase I'm assuming because we start falling behind in objectives. 

But the thing is, If i'm showing up to do objectives and my team abandons me to do them by myself and I get ganked, it's infuriating not to mention how much it sets me back. And once my team refuses to help and I decide to focus on farming and ganking a lane, all of a sudden they want to do objectives and blame me for not showing up any more. I'm not saying I'm perfect and I don't make mistakes but this is honestly what I'm dealing with and I have no freakin clue what I could possibly do different. 

A few years ago in my silver/gold elo I would ping and people would show up. But in bronze everyone knows better, no one will listen to pings unless they want to. But back in the day people would show up for better or worse, even when it might look a little sketch but because people at least came it would work out more time than not. It's like I'm being hard punished for my old league behaviors that used to have good pay offs. 

What's more perplexing is bronze players used to be uniformly terrible, they would be absolutely free and so climbing out of bronze if you are a competent in one of the main roles was easy. But now it's very different. You will play against people in bronze that just steam roll your team, meanwhile your team is inting, trolling or just getting out played. Anyways, I need to get a better strategy that pays off every single time. If there is a for sure, guaranteed strategy that will pay off I want to do that. Taking risks hoping my team will pay attention to pings/objectives seems like too much of a gamble. 

Anyways, I don't want to complain. I just want a course correction. As soon as I get out of bronze the IQ points will be raised enough that this shouldn't be a problem.",Level_Mycologist_947,17/03/23 03:17:39 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11t3gow/need_help_with_jungle_advice/

leagueoflegends,Potential Mordekaiser Rework Concept," 

With how simple Morde is to play and since i was laying awake at night unable to sleep i thought of a potential rework for our Man Morde, I would like to know what you all think of this rework and what changes you think should be made to it if some were to be made.:

His passive wouls be called ""Inevitable End"" and would say: ""Mordekaiser lust for war and his battle knowledge tells him that a war won through Attrition is still a war won. Every 5 minutes Mordekaiser grows in size and gains:

5 min: 5 AP, 5 AD, and 5 Ability Haste

10 min: 10 AP, 5 Ability Haste, and 5 Mobility

15 min: 10 AP, 10 Ability Haste, and 10% Tenacity (edited)

20 min: 15 AP, 10 Mobility, and 5% Omnivamp

25 min: 20 Armor, 20 Magic Resist, and 10% Tenacity (edited)

30 min: 10 AP, 5 Ability Haste, and 50 Range

35 min: 15 Armor, 15 Magic Resist, 10% True damage resistance

At 40 minutes Mordekaiser Reaches full Power turning the Summoners rift Dark with a light turqouise Haze as he grows an additional 25% and gains 1000 Health, 50 AP, 50 AD, 100 Armor, 100 Magic Resisty, 50 Ability Haste, 50 Mobility, 50% Tenacity, and 25% Omnivamp

(This last part of the passive is subject to change i just thought it would be badass and 40 minute games are pretty rare so why not)

His Q would Would be the same except it would not have isolation damage, the damage it does now would be increased by an additional 50% and would be split half and half between AP and AD Damage and instead has a passive called:

""Soul Harvester""

""Mordekaiser Harvests the souls of the weak to build his Citadel in the ream of the dead"" Every time Mordekaiser hits an opponent with Obliterate he gains a stack of ""Soul Harvester"" When Mordekaiser ults the enemy team loses health equal to twice the amount of stacks you have and every other Champion on your team other than yours gains health equal to twice the amount of stacks you have. (10 Second Cooldown)

His W would still give a shield but would state:

""Unbreakable"" Every time Mordekaiser Activates this Shield It gains an additional 5 health permanently stacking infinitely

His E would be: ""Soul Burst"" ""All have the same distinct look of fear in their eyes when they look upon the Iron Revenant as they know their end is Nye""

When Mordekaiser Activates this ability he unleashes a burst of Demonic energy dealing AP damage equal to your Soul Harvester Stacks. Additionaly if Unbreakable is active his shield also breaks bursting in a larger area dealing 10% of the shields Health applying a 25% slow and putting unbreakable on a 15 second cooldown uneffected by ability haste.

His R would be: ""The Convergence""

""Mordekaiser Brings all Champions within a 1500 Range into his Citadel in the death realm trapping them for 5 seconds per enemy champion in the Realm with him. Allied champions gain an additional 10 mobility while in this realm"" this no longer steals stats once you leave the death realm",Mordekaiser_Enjoyer_,17/03/23 05:27:28 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11t6tsf/potential_mordekaiser_rework_concept/

leagueoflegends,A possible solution for balancing terrible modifiers for ADCs on ARAM,"Take Ashe for example, having a  -15% damage dealt. This was done to balance Ashe around her support poke build, which was successful to an extent but made her typical adc build terrible to play.

So instead of decreasing overall damage dealt, it can be split into 3 categories:

Attack Damage Dealt, Spell Damage Dealt, and Item Damage Dealt

By decreasing her Spell damage dealt and Item damage dealt modifiers instead of normal Attack damage dealt, Ashe could possible no longer be forced to play Mandate every game and now have a choice of playing a normal ADC when the team needs one.",KaffyisTaken,14/03/23 05:13:52 PM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11r1dpz/a_possible_solution_for_balancing_terrible/

leagueoflegends,Rammus ult NEEDS to be reworked or reverted.,"Hi, my name is Foal and I've been a Rammus main for 5+ years now. I don't play league often, I peaked in plat and haven't played more than 30 games of ranked in one season since 2017 just getting gold every season.

Yes I'm low elo, however no one high elo actually plays Rammus (proof that his ult didn't modernize him). You can see with the link below that he has 2 picks in professional play after his rework in S12 and the most he was used was S6

 [Rammus stats - Games of Legends (gol.gg)](https://gol.gg/champion/champion-stats/71/season-ALL/split-ALL/tournament-ALL/) 

The rework of Rammus ultimate in 2021 objectively made him worse and I need your help to get him reworked/ reverted. I am happy to debate further with anyone in the comments with a valid point but for now here is my basic reasonings as to why.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Rammus is now significantly worse at getting onto targets

While Rammus new ult does jump over minions it is still incredibly easy to dash/flash out of. His Q alone is not. If you Dash/Flash while Rammus is rolling towards you, often times he will still be able to catch up with his increased movement speed. His Ultimate ends his Q so if you flash/dash out of it, you're safe from the gank as he no longer has any movement to get back to you. You now have to rely on your teammates to get important cooldowns before engaging when old Rammus did not.

2. Rammus is now significantly worse at sticking onto targets 

Rammus's new ult places his stacking slow on the ground rather than being a circle around him. Meaning that once you get out of the ult on the ground you're no longer slowed. As compared to old Rammus who had his stacking slow attached to himself meaning that even as your opponent's dash/flash/walk away, they are still constantly being slowed by the Rammus sticking onto them, allowing your teammates to quickly catch up and damage them. 

Riot even admits this is true by buffing his W to now longer slow Rammus. This was never an issue in the past because you were slowing your opponent's more than yourself with the old ult. But now even without being slowed by your W it feels impossible to stick to targets due to not having your slow.

3. Engaging with Rammus ult no longer allows you to knock opponents back.

New Rammus ult allows you to get over walls so ghost has become an infinitely more favorable summoner spell than flash (used to be a split argument in the community). There's a major problem with this. When you engage with your ultimate (and the off chance that it actually hits without someone dashing/flashing out) it knocks them straight up and after taunt you're free to try to leave. However with old rammus ult the only way to engage was with your Q, which knocks the target away from Rammus a small distance rather than just up and down. This allows you to get behind the target either with your increased movement speed or with flash to knock them towards your allies while you constantly body block the opponent trying to escape the gank

4. He does significantly less damage with his ganks

With the addition of being worse at sticking onto targets, this makes Rammus do significantly less damage with his ganks. Opponents are now very quick to get out of your ult on the ground. Whether they flash/dash out before it lands or flash/dash/walk out after your taunt in it, they typically only eat 0-1 ticks of your ultimate before it's no longer useful. Old Rammus ult lasted a total of 8 seconds and it is nearly impossible to walk away from due to its stacking slow. Allowing Rammus to hit you with his enhanced auto attacks as well as hitting almost every tick of his ultimate's damage.

5. It worsens his ability to peel

In later game teamfights Rammus used to be a god at peeling for his teammates. With a stacking slow and a long taunt your ADC's typically could nuke down the tank/bruiser trying to dive them in the backline. New Rammus ult simply sucks at peeling in comparison. You can't knock the opponent away with your Q, and your stacking slow hardly/doesn't affect the tank. You are either forced to not use your R or only have a taunt.

   6. Increased cooldown means you can't viably use it on towers

Rammus used to have decent tower damage due to the fact that his ultimate can be used to damage towers. However, his new Ult has a cooldown of 130/110/90 and his old was 100/80/60. This change in increased ultimate CD means that you are wasting your ultimate if you ever use it on a tower because more than likely you'll need it again before it comes off CD. This was not always the case with his old Ultimate. The shorter CD allowed you to use it to push out that extra tower damage.

&amp;#x200B;

I truly wholeheartedly believe that Rammus is worse off with his new ultimate but his player base is too small for people listen to the argument that it's worse, and on paper it ""sounds"" better. 

Possible Solutions:  


1. Just revert the ultimate. It did its job better than the new one.
2. Make the stacking slow last longer and be attached to Rammus like the old ult
3. If you fail to hit the ultimate, your Q doesn't end

&amp;#x200B;

P.S. 

Some of you may be thinking that he was just recently relevant in solo Q early this season, however I want to remind all of you that was due to Jak 'Sho's working amazingly with his W and has nothing to do with his ult rework. After his rework he was just as underplayed and underused as always.",Foal1,16/03/23 12:59:41 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11s2as2/rammus_ult_needs_to_be_reworked_or_reverted/

leagueoflegends,Riot doesn't seem to understand Skarner's conflict.,"I don't care whether or not Skarner is a crystal scorpion or has any ties to hextech, but I do feel it's weird how they remove the ""nature vs. technology"" message from him. It wasn't really a genocide story, IMO, it was mostly about humans (and magical freaks) messing with nature for their gain. I do hope the lore team remembers the whole ""Ixtal jungle is getting mowed down by giant bulldozers"" plot and lets Skarner participate  in this conflict somehow. 

Maybe even lets Skarner keep his ""last of his kind"" conflict? Right now it seems like they don't understand who Skarner is as a character.

The blog post makes Skarner look like he's just some beta bitch: ""Skarner’s whole being has revolved around him being a sad, defeated, lonely scorpion who misses his kind..."" Like it's an embarrassment to be sad over your whole kind's death and miss them. And where was Skarner defeated? In his short story for a brief moment? The one where he fought with even more vigor by the end? 

For me Skarner seemed to be a character who didn't lose hope even while fighting for his kind's survival completely alone. He wasn't just sad and depressed, he didn't want to surrender, he kept pursuing his goals no matter the odds. And for the writer it's just a ""sad, defeated, lonely scorpion""... It's like saying that Aatrox is just some sad, defeated and lonely demon dude (who is also angry sometimes). It misses the point completely. 

I think they can still make Skarner fight for his brethren even in Ixtal. Maybe Piltovian machines pollute the land somehow, or maybe Shirimans hunted the brakern long ago for some resources (this is not really a technology vs. nature plot, but still is civilization vs. nature).

I do hope the team listens to feedback and will consider some of the things Skarner enthusiasts suggest (even if there's like ten of them).",HellDancer1337,18/03/23 06:45:07 PM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11uks31/riot_doesnt_seem_to_understand_skarners_conflict/

leagueoflegends,I'm genuinely surprised how many NA mid &amp; adc have no idea about wave clearing in midgame.,"I've played a lot of games here in NA server and been surprised that many of NA players have no idea about macro games.

I'm not talking about strategies that are mainly used in challenger or grandmaster elo or pro scene.

It's just basic macro if you play league of legends.

I played with these mid vlad (plat) &amp; mf (diamond) on my team, and it was a standoff situation around the drag except me (top) and ksante (we both had tp) and the opponent J4 had herald.

Suddenly mf gave up clearing mid waves and pinged drag to take, meanwhile the j4 released herald in mid and they pushed from the first tower to inhiv while our team was taking the drag.

I just didn't understand, I already back pinged them but they carried on taking drag. I asked mf why she gave up mid and rushed to drag all of a sudden, she goes ""bruh otherwise we wouldn't have taken drag"" I was like ""wtf taking drag is more worthy than giving up mid towers?""

Also, vlad kept going to bot lane for split push, I don't find it, in and of itself, bad but if you don't have tp and you're playing a mage then you shouldn't push the wave more than a half of the lane (especially if their 1st tower is still alive).

Like, as long as you push the wave to the enemy's tower, then you can join the group in mid. Vlad isn't jax or fiora who can take down towers. But this vlad would never come to mid but just hit the botlane tower instead.

I've seen lots of these types of players here. Also, lots of adc here just go split even though it's their mid or top's job and they can do it instead.

Clearing waves before teamfights or taking objectives is a given. Seriously even Korean golds do these macro plays.",SilasDal,16/03/23 02:04:52 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11s456f/im_genuinely_surprised_how_many_na_mid_adc_have/

So many people who flame me for being an ""egirl,"" or accuse me of getting carried by my ""boyfriend"" to \[insert rank\]. So many people who would outright stat shame me for being X number of games at Y rank. 

I want you all to ignore the haters and prove them wrong. For some people, progress comes slow. It may take you 1k games to improve, and that's perfectly fine. If someone flames your unconventional pick, it'll be okay. Mute and keep playing your best. I've learned to instantly mute anyone who hovers draven or samira in champ select and it's done WONDERS for my mental health. I have no idea what it is about those champions, but they seem to bring out the worst in people. Or maybe the worst of people are drawn to Draven/Sam, idk.

In any case, I wanted to share my success here. As you can see from the screenshot, my IGN is Sona Booty. AMA, I guess, and I'll answer. But this is mostly just a victory post :)

I know I could install lol for Linux anyways but this type of installation has a lot of problems and in most case don't work.

leagueoflegends,Hybrid builds/champs are dead?,"I've played this game since season one and i've been through all the metas, and i'm so sad that most champions builds are too straight forward currently. I don't really know if this problem is because we now have the statistics to prove which builds are better than other via websites and playtesting, but there's no item anymore that gives both ad &amp; ap anymore which is just sad, it's either the one or the other. 

The problem is that the champs that used to go hybrid like Jax, Akali, Corki, Kayle, etc can't do this efficently anymore because each type of damage hard scales with it's type, this means that you will loose a lot of damage due to not being able to get the mandatory items for each type as a consequence.

The mandatory items that i'm talking about are DCAP, IE and Navory, if your not building one of these you won't have any damage. Because there's no mandatory item which boosts both ad&amp;ap damage.

I propose that there needs to be a new mythic item which will boost these two stats and be good enough so that champions that can go hybrid should if your team comp is already balanced in terms of damage type.",Jonathan460,14/03/23 08:07:07 PM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11r4d22/hybrid_buildschamps_are_dead/

leagueoflegends,The Ballad of League of Legends," 

Once upon a time, in a land far and near.  
A game emerged, that made players cheer,  
'League of Legends,' a title so bold,  
A realm of champions, a story untold.

Simple beginnings, with champs we adored,  
A mere handful of heroes, not one was ignored,  
Fingers danced on keys, in battles we’d clash,  
Escaping reality, a respite from the daily bash.

The fields of justice, where we’d unite,  
Anonymously bonded by our gaming might,  
No matter our stresses, or the work we’d elude,  
In Summoner's Rift, joy was pursued.

But as time marched on, the game did transform,  
Complicated kits arose, like a digital swarm,  
Champions galore, each more complex,  
By the time we learned one, we had to learn the next.

The jungle was daunting, the lanes a mess,  
We sought reprieve but found only stress,  
In the heat of the battle, we'd sometimes blurt,  
A few choice words, not meant to hurt.

Yet the hammer came down, on slurs of all size,  
A ban here, a suspension, to our surprise,  
The freedom we craved, now locked in a cell,  
We longed for the days of that sweet, sweet old spell.

Oh, League of Legends, our love and our bane,  
Our refuge, our battleground, our sun and our rain,  
Though times have changed, and our hearts may ache,  
We'll always remember that first thrilling game.",blazebeardswag,19/03/23 01:47:13 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11uuvkd/the_ballad_of_league_of_legends/
leagueoflegends,YamatoCannon: Fnatic was 8-1 in scrims against Damwon KIA before Worlds 2021.,"[SOURCE](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1765819865?t=1h18m23s)

- Fnatic was 8-1 in scrims against eventual finalists Damwon KIA

- Fnatic was 2-4 against semifinalists T1 in scrims

- Fnatic was winning games against purely from Upset/Hyli creating a massive lead from bot lane 2v2

- YamatoCannon has the VODs of these scrims saved and hopes to be able to release them one day.

- At Worlds 2022, Fnatic was losing to everyone in scrims


-------------------

This just makes it all the sadder that Upset had to go before Worlds started in 2021. Obviously scrims don't mean everything but 8-1 is fucking impressive.

Fnatic had by far the easiest group of any EU team and now it seems they *might* have been able to do well.

The changes to Navori Quickblades have skyrocketed their use, but have also led to many classes not picking up a Mythic at all, which defeats the purpose of Mythics. 

Obviously tweaks to the items would be necessary if this were the case, but did Riot inadvertently address the critique many people have of Marksman Mythics, that they do not define the gameplay style of Marksman enough?

leagueoflegends,Riot REALLY needs to change the requirements for ranked queue,"I just lost a game due to two players being completely new to ranked: One of them was an ARAM only player who was clearly not very experienced, and decided to try out ranked for the first time, and the other was a level 31 player who's very first game against other people was ranked, and was VERY clearly completely new to the game and had no idea what was going on. Obviously, they both give up kills like crazy, the enemy is up 8 kills by 8 minutes, and the game is over from there. Our ADC who was  paired with the new player went giga-toxic towards them, and basically gave up 10 minutes in.

I'm not gonna pretend like this happens every other game, but I can distinctly recall something like this happening roughly 5 times to me this past week (maybe 20-25 or so games). I feel like the requirements for ranked queue are WAY too loose, and it encourages new players to try it and end up with a bad experience. From what I can tell, the level 30 minimum requirement just translates to ""Grind out a bunch of bot games, and once you're 30, you're ready!"", which is obviously not the case. In my opinion there should either be a minimum number of draft games played before ranked (maybe 50 or so), a much higher level cap (75-100), or some kind of mission checklist before hand (get a certain amount of vision score in a set amount of games, get a number of KP/assists, or just straight up a number of draft games won). The current system does nothing to tell new players that ""Hey, unless you're a smurf you are absolutely not ready for ranked"", and it bogs down the quality of games in the average elos, (which im sure reddit is familar with), while also giving a really bad experience to the new player.",bongodongowongo,12/03/23 12:38:19 PM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11p5dhp/riot_really_needs_to_change_the_requirements_for/

leagueoflegends,Is toxicity affecting mage botlane stats?,"(tl;dr Could prejudices against unorthodox picks actually affect their success/winrate?)

So I'm a lowly plat scrub, and have recently been on a mage botlane streak with some really good results. I feel more agency than playing as regular adc and can destroy towers just the same with insane AP and stuff like Ziggs W. My personal winrate with them is quite high, much higher than with traditional adcs. So **personally** (I'm not trying to convert people, just speaking for myself) I'd be statistically worsening my chances of winning by picking a regular adc.

Yet, I'm constantly on edge and have to feel like I'm playing ghost/cleanse Nunu by the way people react to me. As soon as anything goes slightly off track, regardless of where and why, I'm to blame. Botlane is even but topside lost 2v2? Bg report Veigar trollpick. It's so absurd that just going even is not enough. If I and supp match the enemy botlane and perform slightly better, but the enemy has a fed JG who got his lead topside, somehow it's our fault.

It really feels like if you're doing anything short of actively carrying by a significant margin, you're under everyone's crosshairs. And of course, god forgive you if you actually get gapped, because you will never hear the end of it. I get less flame when I lose a winning matchup without enemy jg pressure as Cait because I suck ass, than when I get behind as Ziggs in a 2v4 botlane game.

It's almost a self-fulfilling prophecy at times, where people see you on an unorthodox pick and give up, making them actually lose because of the pick but through no actual fault of that player. So I wonder if I'm just unlucky or is this a widespread phenomenon? Could this behaviour actually affect the performance of these champs? Because with the way my braindead ass is seeing success with them, I wonder if they would perform even better if they didn't also inflict a mental penalty on your own team.",IFV_Ready,14/03/23 07:39:27 PM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11r3tsr/is_toxicity_affecting_mage_botlane_stats/

leagueoflegends,Who is a harder champion? Viego or Sylas,"Both have the niche of stealing abilities from enemies \[viego's case he steals everything \]

&amp;#x200B;

I instantly thought Viego was harder as he had to be able to fully understand his opponents 3 abilities + passive while Sylas only has to know a single ability

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

but it can work both ways as Viego just has to do one ability rotation then use his R while Sylas has to plan accordingly and think about his opponent's ultimate abilities. Not to mention that ults are as unique as they can get and utilizing the proper one at the proper opportunity might not be that easy

What are some good birthday gift ideas? All the merch I can find online kinda sucks or is way overpriced :(",Wh0renado,15/03/23 11:06:05 PM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11rz3qf/birthday_gift_for_bf_that_loves_league/

leagueoflegends,My thoughts on Yuumi on her new changes,"Okay so I played Yuumi and I main her. Her new kit is kinda… “overwhelming”.

Earlier I got to used her in Aram and we won with me attaching to our Draven all the time and not ONCE I unattached to my Draven because they removed her bop ‘n block?? Removing Yuumi’s unattaching to an ally then bopping to get a shield actually made her fairly balanced to kill because she gets out making her very vulnerable for a bit, but this new Yuumi with her Best-Friend passive  kinda mader stupidly broken. Like what do you mean your ADC or Carry get’s a free heal and magic damage on-hit when Yuumi is attached to them, that kinda seems absurd and also somehow her Ult gives free defense and magic resistance too!?

Honestly, as a Yuumi main, this is kinda unhealthy for Yuumi’s new kit. There’s not really a counter to her rn other than buying anti-heal.",Keptical,15/03/23 10:12:36 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11rizux/my_thoughts_on_yuumi_on_her_new_changes/

leagueoflegends,The nerfs to support Ashe on ARAM actively force you to play support Ashe,"\+15% damage taken

\-15% damage done

\+2.5% attack speed scaling

\-20 Ability Haste

&amp;#x200B;

The biggest offenders are the first two. It makes it quite impossible to actually play the game as an adc. You take so much damage and do so little that the only choice you have to play super far back, ironically the only damage you can safely do without getting one shot by a stray ezreal Q is with your W. But your W does so little damage with the nerfs that you are forced to build mandate and use it as a support applying ability. 

I'm not sure what the solution for this is but these nerfs force ashe to be played as a support on aram, which seems to be the opposite of what they wanted. Bonus attack speed isnt enough if you just get killed from anything that looks at you.",schizopedia,14/03/23 05:32:48 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11qmhvn/the_nerfs_to_support_ashe_on_aram_actively_force/

leagueoflegends,Why am i gaining negative LP?," 

Hello, i came here because i am currently gaining negative LP and i can't really figure out the reason or how the system actually works. I was told that more or less for every game won the system adds around 10 to your MMR level and for every loss it subtracts 10, yet it doesn't really seem to work that way.

I ended last season at plat 4 0 lp, but as i switched role from ADC to support my winrate skyrocketed to an insane amount, i am currently plat 2 56 lp and in 73 games i've held an avarage WR of 60%, spiking up to 80% or even 90% at times. Here is some data from my profile:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/dh0h5fnpheoa1.png?width=459&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=8bd781946697859dc6fdd172b983a3de42a046e5

Yet, the more i climb the less LP i get, i started from gaining around 30 and losing 14 to, now, gaining between 18 and 24 and losing between 24 and 27 despite being on a 7 games win streak and having held a steadily widely positive winrate

So how does the system work and how can i fix my gains?

Thanks in advance! In case it's helpful, here is a link to my profile

leagueoflegends,AP DoT Champs need a checkup.,"The sheer terror of anyone building Jak'Sho's with Force of Nature makes it feel miserable to play any DoT chanp. i believe you're now dealing around 40~% less damage against any champion that builds the combo with very little in the form of counterplay given its just a flat damage reduction. 

Then there's Baron buff ontop of all that and suddenly you can't even clear minion waves.

I understand DoT champions aren't popular but surely there's a middle ground between unfair terrors that 1v5 your team from a mile away. And being so underpowered versing even one magic resist item that you might as well focus all your power in becoming a budget version of Yorick as you just spend the game pushing waves and taking towers.

leagueoflegends,Issues With Skarner Thematic Rework,"Skarner has a special place in my heart. The first time I made it to gold, I got it on a 16-win streak with Skarner. I don't understand what Skarner's backstory and theme have to do with his kit. Riot claims that the crystal theme limited their kit design, but literally nothing they presented as a possible kit was unworkable with a crystal theme. I'm confused why it's even a discussion in kit design. The fact that he's a scorpion is the actual constriction. Just design a healthy modern kit and then work the crystal theme into animation and character design. And not every champion needs to be moved to Ixtal. If they're making him an earth bender, wouldn't it make more sense that he's in Shurima, where Taliyah is?  Lastly, not every champion needs to super appeal to everyone. When you have 162 champions and growing, there are always going to be less popular champions. Yuumi is as happy-go-lucky as can be, and she's despised. 

Tldr: Riot consistently makes poor/illogical justifications for their decisions.",CatchCritic,18/03/23 01:27:27 PM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11uff4m/issues_with_skarner_thematic_rework/
leagueoflegends,LPL PSA: Penultimate Week Pre-Playoff Powersurge,"The playoffs around the world are soon approaching, and the LPL is no different. With only one week left after this one, stakes are as high as ever. Here’s the matches this week that should light the fire:

**EDG vs OMG, 12:00PM CET Friday**

OMG are really trying their best to push into the upper part of the bracket, and this last stretch matters immensely for them. Unluckily however, they will have to push through the first place beast that is Edward Gaming, who themselves are gunning for that first place seed to close out the season. 

And especially unlucky for OMG is that the remainder of their schedule all feature strong teams. With playoffs themselves not even secured, every single series matters. However with an exciting young core of Creme and Shanji, they absolutely can come in clutch in the final stretch.

**TES vs BLG, 12:00PM CET Saturday**

Top Esports are absolutely staggering. Being dealt consecutive defeats by LGD, LNG, and TT probably deals as much damage to their egos as it does to their chances of a good playoff run. Regardless, they still have time to recover and regain form and confidence in one fell swoop. BLG, themselves being 8-5 and likely playoff-bound, will be a formidable opponent that if felled can bring the wind back to TES’s sails.

**LNG vs IG, 12:00PM CET Sunday**

IG have always had a healthy rivalry with RNG, but few could have predicted how that would manifest in 2023. Both are straddling the very bottom of the playoff cutoff, and are climbing over each other to desperately secure their spot. Now the fate of this rivalry may very well be dictated by LNG.

Against a top team like this, some would say IG are hopeless. But the beauty of this team, featuring early season breakout YSKM and a solid LCK-proven duo of gideon and Dove, is that they always have the magic to find the hope within the hopeless. And to find some way to topple the Scout-Tarzan nightmare combo, they’ll have to dig pretty deep into their magic reserve.",LPL-Official,17/03/23 04:34:58 PM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11tl87v/lpl_psa_penultimate_week_preplayoff_powersurge/
leagueoflegends,Why are certain champions missing ratios that could scale with other stats?,"I feel like a lot of champions have abilities that are missing ratios on abilities that would make them viable for other builds other than their main scaling.

There are a lot of champions that can build AP and AD and both builds are viable because of these ability scalings.

My question is why is it that some champions seem to be missing these types of scalings and secondary build options when there are plenty of champions that do have them?",thenexusobelisk,15/03/23 10:35:54 PM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11ry973/why_are_certain_champions_missing_ratios_that/

leagueoflegends,Mythics are ruining the game,"That's it nothing more do add. What's the point of this garbage system? Half of the champs don't even build it on the first item, and some don't even build them as second item, while they are supposed to be ultra super powerful items, since they were added, off meta champs feel trash to play, and if you don't have perfect mythic for you, say goodbye to having even ounce of fun against meta champs. AP mythics has been trash since they were added, there are 8 AP MYTHICS, while others have 3-5 which in itself is actually funny. And don't even get me started on the actual dumbster fire which are tank mythics. The same tank mythics that deal so much dmg, champs like Irelia love to build them without losing any dmg, the same tank items that allow literal full tank heroes to one shot carries. Delete this trash system and at least 50% of current complaints about balance will disappear",Demens2137,13/03/23 03:09:40 PM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11q2szz/mythics_are_ruining_the_game/
leagueoflegends,Honor Status,"What do you mean by ""locking the level of Honor and rewards""?

On your profile, you will see a padlock on your Honor level. This means that you cannot advance to the next level and you will not receive any rewards. To unlock the Honor level, just play fair. You will receive a notification when unlocking your Honor level.


What is the bid for levels 1 or 0?

If you drop below level 2 it's because you've received a penalty or two, and the first step is to play a few good games to unlock your Honor level. Once that's done, your next matches help you to level up again and, consequently, get more cool rewards again.


this is what riot says

however no matter how many matches you play the honor level never goes up or should go up normally.
I took two unfair punishments last year and now I don't have any progress in honors anymore",Trevisano,15/03/23 08:24:16 PM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11rutwg/honor_status/

leagueoflegends,Draven in Pro Play,"I’ve been watching all of the LEC this season and seeing Draven go from even to 1K ahead due to his passive seems very unfair. If he’s behind , he can easily come back than other ADCs. What exactly is the down side to picking him atm. His passive is way too OP soon but this is a robbery.",AwesomeEureka,14/03/23 08:23:10 PM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11r4om1/draven_in_pro_play/
leagueoflegends,Playing while not caring about your elo makes the game much more playable,"Basically this. I dropped G1 from G3 and had a literal breakdown, but soon realized all i need was to find one champion i found fun, mute all and literally play for getting better on that since i love playing that. 

I always try, if i don’t win that’s okay because this is a videogame and no one actually cares what elo you are in, except for insecure toxic people that stalk your opgg. Abusing meta champions can be frustrating if you don’t like them too, so if u find tanks boring don’t play them… you will probably int anyways and will not have fun. I literally went from living League like a nightmare to living League like a game again just by this simple mindset, please do that too. Before this I was super negative and toxic towards the goldish mistakes my team did ( which i probably do too but I didn’t realize ) but now i don’t really care about them, since i wanna just play my champ. This helped me a lot, maybe can help other people too.",GenderbentLux,12/03/23 07:40:04 PM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11pcj88/playing_while_not_caring_about_your_elo_makes_the/
leagueoflegends,Clash still has the problem of losing the first game and having your next opponent forfeit,"We absolutely need a reason to stick around in Clash after this first loss. 

Our friends and I were all excited to play in Clash. We unfortunately lose the first game, whatever. Our next opponent drops out, and now our options are wait around for an hour for the next game to finish or drop, which we did.

How has this system not been looked at by now?",Hewligan,12/03/23 11:28:32 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11p3zgs/clash_still_has_the_problem_of_losing_the_first/
leagueoflegends,Kalista situation isn't any good and here's her story in a nutshell+personal opinion,"Kalista is almost a 9 years old champion with just 3 skin+2 championship skin, the second was realesed 6/7 years after the first one.

But let's just not talk only about her skin and how the chroma wont change the spear colour for the second times in a row.

Let's we talk about her lore, she wasn't in the Ruination even that never happen in Ba Sing se despite her being a key character

You don't find her in the Ruination game and Ledros is just there for some min.

They did the book with her as protagonist(coff coff still no f pre ruination skin) but her current lore is forgotten with Ledros.

Realising him as champion could be a really cool thing if paired with the rework she deserve since 2019 or so.

As now since 2019 i think i never ever seen Kalista pick rate so bad, in the last ~10 patch she doesn't go past ~2/3% with some being at 1%, while normaly she had 4/5% even with low wr.

To fit more the Legion of souls her kit could be like the one in LoR, even if just her R so we hopefully won't have nerf over nerf over nerf.

I'm kinda sad that a champion so important for Runeterra lore, with so much skin potentiall, gameplay skill expression etc... isn't that much fun to play with.",ILNOVA,17/03/23 07:41:27 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11tacob/kalista_situation_isnt_any_good_and_heres_her/
leagueoflegends,Is there caster bias?,"Hello everyone, I don’t usually watch competitive league, but when I was watching DK vs T1 just now, I couldn’t help but notice how much the casters tend to hype up T1 and it’s players. For example DK can win a fight and they still kept talking about how T1 have gold leads and how great T1’s players are. They barely mentioned the plays DK made. It also feels like they are almost casting from T1’s side and DK is the enemy instead of casting neutrally. Is it just me? Please be nice even if you disagree.",Arashii_UwU,16/03/23 04:44:42 PM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11soecn/is_there_caster_bias/
leagueoflegends,"So far, that how it feels to have yummi or face her in general in diamond ranks in EUW","I would say from what I saw and not depend on any actual values or data,

it just general feedback from the elo that I play in which is diamond in EUW.

But yummi just went back to ground zero (I would say lower even), that rework done nothing it the same either pick or banned her.

If her adc is useless, she even more useless now cause she can't just build her friendship with another feed members result in actual 5v3 game where the adc and yummi just feeding the enemies till she bond with someone else.

She the same in feeling either burst the holder or just die trying at the best, her healing and shield now stronger due to shield just not easy to break down for most classes aside from mages or assassin.

Let's be honest here, shield always outvalue the heal and now with this rework the anti-heal idea that was good counter to her isn't much of thread since she can just shield on the top of shield of ADC items which result in feed adc to be twice feed.

That what I think to be honest, that what I saw and nothing else no numbers or nerfes will changed my point of view.

The rework was just overbuff for yummi shield at the cost of her heal and making her even more useless if the carry was useless",D50001,13/03/23 08:46:05 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11pv93s/so_far_that_how_it_feels_to_have_yummi_or_face/
leagueoflegends,I just hit the golden Cyberpunk ratio in ARAM,"Some of y'all enjoy SR. Some of y'all enjoy ranked. Some of y'all enjoy watching other people play. I love it all, but since ARAM came out and they ditched all the other fun maps, I've been pretty much stuck there. 

I don't like all the recent balance changes because it creates hyper champions and some champs are nuked to oblivion. I hope you have as much fun as I do!

leagueoflegends,"My working theory on ""Cursed Accounts""","There have been many people who have brought up that some accounts just feel cursed, or stuck, or ""targetted"". It might simply be because your account has gone through a rank soft reset.

Now, it is common knowledge that if you make a new account, you will likely do better on it and climb easier than on your main (depending on age of account usually at least...). Primarily, the commentary is something along the lines of ""i screwed up my account by doing ranked too soon in my first season"".

My theory is that the first season of ranked on an account, is probably the best to climb on. MMR gains are generally more volatile than the losses, so you are very likely to climb fairly quickly. The game kinda tosses you around in its head like the Sorting Hat in Harry Potter going ""hmm...... where to put you..."".

Once the new season hits, if you only have about 100 or so games in... it seems to make your climb harder, because while your MMR is high.... it tries to account for you not doing much ranked by dropping visible rank lower while keeping high MMR. This creates a problem of being vs high tier players, while also being with lower tier players.

Ive had some of the same stuff happen on my own accounts, where the games just felt...... odd after new season. You can watch streamers and see where most of their problems tend to start with their account, etc.

Anyone know where or how to go about seeing if there is validity in this theory? Or have any thoughtful insights on their own accounts (either for, or against this theory)?",Wolfycub2000,16/03/23 01:18:30 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11s2tnl/my_working_theory_on_cursed_accounts/

leagueoflegends,What's wrong with easy champions having skill expression?,"This is something that has been bothering me for a while. Whenever a champion has any sort of skill expression that allows dedicated players to distance themselves from the casual, there's always a very vocal group that always acts like that is the worst thing ever.

Like, Sylas a prime example of this. When he first came out, he felt really good play. He was sexy and had a cool thematic and he is some assassin/fighter hybrid so he was always going to be a high-risk/high reward champion and whatnot. But people soon found out he had one thing in common with Riven. People found ways to animation cancel his Q with his E2, and then his passive, and then his R, and like, eventually people found out you could cancel nearly his entire kit, but it was not something that came naturally. The champion did not become better, you did, as a player. You were able to do things that the vast majority of people who did not extensively play Sylas could not. It was like a prize for dedicating yourself to a champion.

After that, came Caitlyn's trap/net combos that would allow you to fire multiple headshots in quick succession, which were ironically removed with an update that was not meant to change anything but her visuals. These combos were not easy to do, were very situational and gave great depth to an otherwise very simple champion. 

Now we had Yuumi. Yuumi was straight up nerfed because of pro play, and the direction they went with her rework was the polar opposite of what I personally believe should have been done in my opinion. The way that they reworked her was essentially removing all the ""cool things"" that Yuumi could do, if you were good at Yuumi, in favor of turning her into something with absolutely no skill expression at all. Weaving in and out of an ally to apply shields and regain mana and trade health with the enemy ADC because Yuumi's health pool did not matter was arguably the least offensive part of her kit, because it was also the only part allowed the opponents to interact with her on an otherwise always untargetable healer. Now there is very little difference between someone that just started playing League of Legends 5 days ago and someone who has 1000 games on the fucking cat, and that's terrible in my opinion. Why should a player not be rewarded for learning the ins and outs of a champion? Why should a new Yuumi player be three times more effective than another new player who decided to play Soraka instead?

---

And like whenever anything that is very hard to do is discovered with a champion, you see multiple people wanting it removed right away. For example, Gangplank's barrel 1-parts is something that is stupidly hard to do in the heat of the moment. You can grind it down in practice tool but once you try to do them in real matches you will notice how hard they can be, and your reward is not more damage or anything, but making the barrels harder to react to, and contrary to popular belief, Gangplank is already a pretty complex champion as is, even if you decide to keep it simple with him.

People often call these things ""bugs"" and that is why they need to be removed and whatnot. But let's be honest for a moment, if you ever had an IT job, especially as a Game Dev, you know that often times the line between ""bugs"" and ""features"" is very thin. If you find a bug in your game, and it feels good and fun to use, then it was never really a bug, it was a feature, and you won't spend time trying to remove said feature, you will spend time trying to teach your users how to use said feature. There are multiple examples of this in League already. Riven's animation cancelling is still in the game and I don't see them ever being removed ever. Ezreal's Arcane shift's delay was originally intended to be a downsided to essentially having an inbuilt flash on your kit, but it ended up being used as a way to avoid hard CC like Blitz Hook for example, and it felt good to learn the timing and gave Ezreal more depth, so it remained as is.

---

I guess the question is, why shouldn't every champion be like Riven? I don't mean in the literal sense, but like. If you just start playing them, they will be ok, but if you really dedicate yourself to them you can do things that very few people will be able to. 

And it's one of those things that don't even affect regular players. Giving depth to a champion does not necessarily mean they aren't simple at their core.

Riven is one of the most complex champions in the game because of her cancels, but her kit is not necessarily complex by itself. I personally found her way more straightforward than a champion like Shyvana, who really just ran up to you and auto attacked you. Riven would just EQQQ W then walk off. Fuck auto attacking, and this is still true to this day. If you watch a new Riven player play, they will do exactly that on repeat, and like, it's not good, but it gets the job done, well, kinda depends on the matchup, but I'm certain you get the idea of what I am saying.

---

I come from fighting games background, so it's fucking crazy to me seeing people celebrate the removal of skill expression out of games like this. Whenever I see someone do some crazy shit with some character, I don't want it removed because I can't do it, or because it's ""unfair"" to the other side. It's something to be celebrated. Maybe if you dedicate yourself enough to that, you will be able to do that shit one day.

And why not just give those sort of things to everyone? Instead of taking them away. Like, take a simple champion like Garen, and well, just give him some to distinguish the good garen from the great garens? Like, instead of giving his W 60% tenacity for the first 0.75 seconds, make it give him 100% tenacity decaying by 20% each 0.2 seconds. So the better you time your W, the bigger the reward you get out of it, even becoming completely CC immune for a twentieth of a second with the best possible timing. This would give you roughly 12 frames of CC immunity, which really just means you will power through a knock back or something. I don't know, it's just an idea.",Final_Foot_Fucker,14/03/23 11:03:40 PM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11r8j5j/whats_wrong_with_easy_champions_having_skill/

leagueoflegends,Can we talk about the 4 stacks ff'ing games at 15 minutes in normal games,"So I usually play ranked and stick to the few champions I know how to play and recently I've been trying to learn new champs in top/mid in normal games. Most games I am being matched with 4 stacks or vs a 4/5 stack. I'm not pulling any pro player performance that's for sure, but I'm at least not doing terribly, it doesn't really matter I am here to practice and learn. The problem is most of the time I can't even do that, because if the 4 stack I am paired with or the enemy 4/5 stack is losing slightly I can expect a ff around 15 or 20 minutes. 

One example that actually really pissed me off was a game where we had just lost a fight and traded 1 for 4 because of a missplay and then my team immediatly surendered at 19 minutes even though the enemy team got nothing but kills for it, we had just gotten the second dragon and only lost the fight after, but we had all dragons, herald and 2 turrets vs zero for them. When I checked the game stats, even after losing that fight at the end, we were ahead in gold and we had 2 scaling champions on our team that were really close to powerspike and no one was particularly fed on their team.

What I'm trying to say is that I feel like I am just wasting time and barely have any control over if I spend a quality game or just throw away 30 minutes of my life for no reason. I spend at least 5 minutes in queue and champ select then 20 minutes in a game where I'm most likely never going to see my jungler or get any help in any way because I'm not pre-made with my team; And it's all for nothing, because my team/enemy pre-made is on Discord and they decided that the game is not worth playing because they encountered the slightest resistance 15 minutes into the game. When I'm matched with all solo players or anything less than a 4 stack, there is a chance to discuss between us if the game is worth playing, I am aware we can't win them all. When the no ping, no typing 4 stack suddenly decide on comms that they want to ff a very winnable game when it's still early it's extremely frustrating.

I don't know how this could possibly be fixed to be honest. I wish there was an option in normals to find a game where it's all solo/duo players even if it took 5 minutes more to search for a game, still better than flipping a coin to see if I waste 30 minutes. Maybe the surrender system needs some tweaking for when the majority of players are in a pre-made since they will most likely all vote the same regardless of what they personally want to vote. Do I just need to go into ranked and not care about possibly ruining the game for my team because I'm trying to learn new champions and I want to actually play the game?",xDankSkank,17/03/23 12:23:32 PM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11tgx4e/can_we_talk_about_the_4_stacks_ffing_games_at_15/

leagueoflegends,What were teams' standings when they swapped players in the LCS?,"I am especially curious about Emenes, with C9 being 14-4 atm. I remember he lost his first game on stage so c9 must have only had 3 losses when he was brought on the team.

But I am also interested in other teams.

Dignitas swap won't be reflected in their wins probably, but they did look a lot better with Tomo. For other teams I wonder how much they got out of exchanging their players.

Does anyone know the teams' standings or where I can see sth like ""standings at date xyz""?

Thanks in advance for any reply :)",Psyman2,19/03/23 03:33:01 AM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11uxt03/what_were_teams_standings_when_they_swapped/

leagueoflegends,Yuumi should've gotten tools that encourage hopping off and switching carries instead of being forced to be in one person,"Yuumi currently has no real reason to hop off from her carry or switch from it and that was the biggest complain everyone what with her.

Instead of feline friendship passive, she should've gotten a passive that encourages hopping off to auto attack more often, a different take on her old passive.

First of all, lower yuumi's current E shield to make up for the next changes

For the passive, I was thinking something in the lines of ""Passive gains a charge once every 8 seconds up to 4. When you auto attack, gain a 6.25% Shield Power bonus (stacking up to 25%) that is consumed the next time you grant a shield.""

As for her W, maybe yuumi should get a decaying flat amount of bonus shielding and healing for X seconds each time she hops into a new champion, with an an individual cooldown per champion. (And give W a min. Cooldown of like 2 seconfd for when she switched champions or hops off)

That way, proactive Yuumi players that consistenly hop off to auto attack and switch champions will get a beffier shield at the cost of giving enemies more room to punish her, while AFK yuumis will heal and shield a lesser amount than the average enchanter

The goal is to make yuumi a more proactive champ while keeping her simple for newer players",TooBad_Vicho,14/03/23 11:31:47 PM,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11r9af2/yuumi_shouldve_gotten_tools_that_encourage/
